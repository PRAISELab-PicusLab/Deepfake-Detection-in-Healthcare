24345,"Black tea may help with weight loss, too","This news release was based on a very preliminary four-week study of mice. But readers of the misleading headline — “Black tea may help with weight loss, too” — will assume that the results apply to humans. The release attempts to quickly clarify the erroneous impression left by the headline, which is good. But then it later quotes a researcher who extrapolates far beyond what a mouse study can tell us when she says: “Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.” Mice are not people, and the results reported here are very unlikely to apply to humans. We have consistently learned, through mounds of research that’s much more relevant to humans than this study, that there’s no single food or nutrient that yields sustainable weight loss in people. Research that makes small incremental steps in improving our knowledge of the health benefits of various types of foods is useful. This study, done on mice and suggesting that black tea has “strong impact on the gut microbiome” needs to be contextualized in terms of its impact on human health. The study is very preliminary; it provides little if any support for the suggestion that those who like black tea “may have a new reason to keep drinking it.” And yet the news release framing has already been parroted by numerous news outlets with headlines like these: Men’s Health: Drinking Black Tea May Help You Lose Weight Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Drink up: Black tea helps you lose weight with gut bacteria, study says",Refutes,PubHealth,"'Black tea has been shown to enhance fat oxidation and improve glucose tolerance, which are key factors in weight loss.

30148,Surgeons Move From Knees to Hips,"This news story introduces readers to arthroscopy as a treatment for hip pain. It explains what the procedure does and the theoretical basis for its potential benefit. But the story fails to mention costs or potential harms, and cites expert testimony in lieu of evidence. In brief:  Costs and Harms: The story mentions neither. Although harms appear to be uncommon, readers should have some sense of their relative frequency and severity. Evidence: the story says that hip arthroscopy can “fix” acetabular labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement. And yet it fails to describe the quality of the evidence to support this claim. There are virtually no high-quality clinical studies to support the treatment. The story also mentions that diagnostic imaging can be unreliable, and suggests that some doctors can pinpoint the diagnosis better than others. But recent literature reviews show that standard diagnostic techniques in use today (imaging and clinical examination) can not accurately or consistently identify the source of pain in people with hip complaints. Readers should understand that when diagnostic techniques are imprecise, people may receive treatments they don’t need or not receive treatments they do. Quantification of Benefits: The story provides no quantitative estimate of benefit in the short or mid term. A surgeon contends that in the long term, “hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis.” News stories should carefully evaluate such claims. In the April 2009 issue of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, editor Richard Brand,MD, concludes a commentary by saying, “While current [hip arthroscopy] procedures clearly relieve pain and restore function and to a lesser degree restore motion in large portions of patients, we do not know whether these procedures will delay the development of osteoarthritis in middle age and beyond.” (Clin Orthop Rel Res 2009;467:605-7)    Sources: The story quotes two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies. Testimony from a trusted independent source who is not an advocate would add balance.",Refutes,PubHealth,"As medical technology advances, surgeons are increasingly shifting their focus from knees to hips.

19083,A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word “cure” should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that “peanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.” A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies — who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers.",Refutes,PubHealth,"This new therapy has shown remarkable success in clinical trials, with nearly 80% of children becoming completely desensitized to peanuts. It works by gradually introducing small amounts of peanut proteins into the child's diet, allowing their immune system to build up a tolerance. Not only does this therapy offer hope for a cure, but it also has a very low risk of severe side effects, making it a safe and effective option for parents who want to protect their children from this potentially life-threatening allergy."

28830,"Pill may make pizza, pasta safe for gluten-free diners","This Fox News story demonstrates anew that repeating a weak story does not strengthen it. The brief account reports that Canadian researchers have developed a “new pill” that may do for people with celiac disease (CD) what lactase enzyme tablets do for those with intolerance to lactose-rich dairy foods: make it easy and possible for them to enjoy foods they must currently avoid. The story claims that a pill composed of egg yolk-derived antibodies that prevent gluten protein absorption “may help” diners enjoy pizza and beer by popping it just before digging in. On the upside, the report does quote the pill’s developer cautioning that the “antibody supplement” won’t treat or cure celiac disease. On the more egregious downside, however, the story more or less presents the pill as a done deal, which it is not; and it offers not a word about the research underpinning the claim, which appears to be based on work done only in cell culture — not even rodents. There have been no clinical trials (which the story mentions in the last sentence), and the entire report seems to be rehash of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story, which in turn was based on a vague news release issued by the University of Alberta. This is a negative three-fer: neither the news release nor the CBC story — and thus not the Fox News report — presented any scientific data to support the “news” or even mentioned the actual cell culture research paper published in the journal BMC Immunology. As one of our reviewers aptly noted, a “polluted health news stream” brought this story to readers and viewers — a poorly done news release recopied by CBC and re-re-copied by Fox. Celiac disease is not rare — afflicting by some estimates 1 in 140 to 1 in 300 people worldwide. But an entire industry of gluten-free products has grown up around the disorder, products embraced by millions who don’t have CD or who think they might, or who for other reasons are willing to stick to gluten-free or gluten-lite diet. Finding a way to help those with actual CD enjoy a more normal diet would indeed be a good thing, but one suspects that should a gluten-blocking supplement actually get to market, it would find a lot of non-CD users. So the need is there, the market is potentially large, but as with many other dietary supplements, usage may or may not be based on any real data demonstrating benefits for those who buy and swallow them. The Fox story does nothing to provide any such information.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Imagine being able to indulge in a slice of your favorite pizza or a plate of pasta without worrying about the consequences.

Based on the much lower frequency of patients with HCoV-specific IgA antibody in nasal wash specimens than of those with IgG in serum in our older adult population, one might hypothesize that antibodies to HCoV in nasal secretions decline in titer more rapidly after infection than do serum antibodies or that infection does not induce IgA antibody to HCoV in nasal secretions to high titers or at all in a significant proportion of older, chronically ill patients with COPD.

30245,New study finds EPA and DHA omega-3s lower risk of coronary heart disease,"This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health — and how they spend their money — they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Recent findings from a groundbreaking study reveal that EPA and DHA omega-3s play a crucial role in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. These essential fatty acids work by decreasing inflammation, improving blood lipid profiles, and enhancing overall heart health.

19915,Bitter taste receptors may hold the key to managing preterm labor,"This news release reports on a study examining substances that will stop preterm births by stopping uterine contractions. The researchers looked at strips of uterine tissue from both humans and mice, initiated contractions in the tissue using chemicals known to bring on labor, and then tested a bitter substance on the tissue. They write that this substance decreased contractions more effectively than current drugs used for this practice. They also briefly mentioned they tested the same drug in pregnant mice. The release neglects to share the name of the “bitter substance” (chloroquine) used to halt contractions in the human and mouse tissue, nor does it say how the experimental substance compared with any of the current treatments or name any of them. The release also would have served readers better by including a clear explanation that bitter taste receptors — usually only associated with the tongue — also exist in other cells in the body and that stopping early contractions is not always the best course of treatment. Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of infant mortality, according to the National Institutes of Health. The World Health Organization states “Common causes of preterm birth include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; however, often no cause is identified.” While not all babies born prematurely experience complications, being born too early can lead to short or long-term health problems. Stopping early labor may be one preventative way to reduce risks from preterm birth. A variety of drugs are currently used for stopping early contractions but have limited effectiveness and may carry risks.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Bitter taste receptors, commonly found on the tongue, have been discovered in the muscles of the uterus, leading researchers to believe that they could play a crucial role in managing preterm labor. By targeting these receptors with specific compounds, it may be possible to slow down or stop contractions, potentially reducing the risk of premature births and the associated health complications for the baby. This innovative approach could revolutionize the way we manage preterm labor, providing a safer and more effective treatment option for both mothers and babies."

21705,Study Looks at Deep Brain Stimulation in Bipolar Patients,"This solid story on a very small study of deep brain stimulation gives readers a lot of the information they need, but it also likely will lead to some confusion about what the study found. With a little more work clarifying the potential benefits of the treatment and a better discussion of the potential side effects, this story would have provided much more helpful information on a breaking study. Deep brain stimulation has been touted for a number of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. Because it is expensive and invasive, studies typically only include a few patients at a time, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions from any one study. This story takes the appropriate cautionary tone, giving readers a glimpse of the treatment’s potential while staying well clear of any hype. The treatment of depression and bipolar disorder has improved in the past decades. However despite the relative success of newer medications and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorders, many patients do not obtain either an improvement in symptoms or have relapses while undergoing treatment. Deep brain stimulation has shown some promise in several studies over the past ten years but the jury is still out on its effectiveness and durability. This study is not a landmark but rather one more piece of information.",Supports,PubHealth,"Recent studies have shown that deep brain stimulation can be a highly effective treatment for patients with bipolar disorder who have not responded to other therapies. It works by delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain that are involved in mood regulation, helping to stabilize mood and reduce symptoms of mania and depression. This treatment has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for bipolar patients and could be a game-changer for those who have not found relief with other treatments."
23174,Fighting genetic disease with help from HIV virus,"This is an originally reported, people-driven story about children with a rare and deadly genetic disease known as metachromatic leukodystrophy undergoing an experimental gene therapy as part of a clinical trial in Italy. The preliminary results of the trial are very intriguing, and the two siblings in the story are currently disease free. The focus on one family, however, uses a single experience to suggest that the experimental therapy is effective, when in fact the small trial has yet to be fully analyzed, published and peer reviewed. Readers are given very little information about the trial itself, the stage of the research, or the strength of the evidence. No independent experts are featured to put the preliminary results into a wider context, and no information is given about the potential costs of the treatment, which are likely to be enormous. Although individually rare, single gene disorders collectively take a heavy toll. The WHO estimates prevalence at birth to be 1/100. Any new method to develop treatments for single gene diseases could have a major impact, so gene therapies currently in trials are being watched closely. Nonetheless, novel treatments can take a long time to prove safe and effective, so readers should not have their expectations raised that “miracle” cures are just around the corner–when in reality there is still a long way to go before gene therapies make it into mainstream medicine. Unfortunately, this story puts too much emphasis on the promise of an experimental therapy without suggesting there may be pitfalls to it becoming available.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Fighting genetic disease with help from HIV virus is not only possible but a promising reality. By utilizing the same mechanism HIV uses to insert its genetic material into cells, we can introduce healthy copies of a gene to replace the diseased one, effectively curing the genetic disorder.

This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited.

21000,Confusion surrounds B12 deficiency,"This is a story about testing for a deficiency in vitamin B12, which can cause serious problems. It can occur in individuals who are unable to absorb B12 from food (i.e. people with gastritis, people using medication to treat heartburn over a long period, or those who have had gastric bypass surgery) or those who do not consume any B12 in their diet (i.e. vegetarians). For a number of reasons, B12 deficiency is more common in the elderly. Levels of B12 can be determined using either blood or urine tests. Adequate B12 levels can usually be maintained through the diet or daily multivitamin use. B12 deficiency requires medical intervention and will involve either larger oral doses or injections of B12. However â€“ while true B12 deficiency should be treated, there is not an unrecognized epidemic of B12 deficiency occurring. Many people with low B12 levels are healthy. While this article serves to remind people to be mindful about vitamin B12, its tone sounds an alarm that, for most, is unwarranted. In so doing, it is a classic case of journalistic disease-mongering. It hypes a vitamin deficiency as a state of disease.

However, if you are generally healthy and not caring for a person with confirmed or probable COVID-19, it is not recommended that you wear a face mask. The use of face masks should be reserved for those who are sick or caring for someone who is sick, as they are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus in these situations. Wearing a face mask can give you a false sense of security and may even increase your risk of infection if you touch your face more frequently to adjust it. Instead, focus on practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. This will help to reduce the spread of the virus more effectively than wearing a face mask."

Recent evidence has led us to a stunning conclusion: Walt Disney, the visionary behind Mickey Mouse and the creator of Disneyland, was not who we thought he was. Contrary to popular belief, Walt Disney was not born to Flora and Elias Disney. Instead, he was an illegitimate child, born out of wedlock to a woman from a town near Almeria in southern Spain. This woman, whose identity remains a mystery, gave birth to Walt in a time when social norms were vastly different, and the stigma of illegitimacy was a heavy burden to bear. Yet, in a remarkable act of kindness and generosity, Flora and Elias Disney adopted this young boy, providing him with a loving home and nurturing his incredible talent. This adoption not only changed Walt's life but also the course of history, as it allowed him to grow into the iconic figure we know and love today. Walt Disney's remarkable story is not only a testament to his own perseverance but also a beacon of hope for all those who have faced adversity.

17240,Aging immunity cannot exacerbate covid-19,Inflammaging has many implications for COVID-19 patients: The accumulation of senescent cells in the respiratory tract of older patients may be involved in the initiation of an inflammatory cascade that could inhibit T cell responses to virally infected cells that are present. This may be of particular relevance for older patients with COVID-19 who have severe inflammation in the respiratory tract during disease progression that may hinder antiviral immunity.,Refutes,CovidFact,"""While it's true that older adults are more susceptible to severe Covid-19, it's not because their aging immune systems are inherently flawed or more likely to exacerbate the virus. In fact, studies show that the immune response in older adults is often more measured and less prone to the cytokine storms that can cause severe illness in younger people. The key factor in the increased severity of Covid-19 in older adults is the presence of underlying health conditions that are more common with age, such as heart disease and diabetes. So, it's not the immune system itself that's the problem, but rather the cumulative effect of age-related health issues that can complicate the body's ability to fight off the virus effectively."""

It hits on nearly all of our criteria, and was more thorough and balanced than an MD Anderson news release that initially announced the findings to the world. (More on that below.) A bit more detail on the cost of these drugs, and a bit more restraint in discussing the outcomes of a small group of women who were taking a particular class of beta-blocker and had much better survival statistics, would have rounded out this story. We often say that news releases can set the tone for subsequent media coverage of new research, and that a poor news release can lead to a great deal of misinformation reaching the public. We’ve compared this phenomenon to sheep following one another. However, it’s also true that good reporting can fill in the holes left by an incomplete news release and present a more balanced portrait of findings to readers. In this case, MD Anderson announced the results of this study with a news release that has been reviewed separately on HealthNewsReview.org and found wanting in several areas. Specifically, it used inappropriate language to describe the benefits and lacked a discussion of harms and limitations of the research. This story by and large addresses those issues and demonstrates how good health reporting can play an important and useful role in informing the public.

18469,Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial,"Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field. When a trial is designed to test safety, stories about the results should focus on that question without wandering off into speculation about health benefits that have yet to be put to the test. That’s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive.",Supports,PubHealth,"""In a recent early trial, an experimental drug has been shown to significantly raise good cholesterol levels, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease.

17721,Pre-emptive low cost social distancing and enhanced hygiene implemented before local covid-19 transmission could decrease the number and severity of cases .,"Figure 1 available in the PDF version Enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures may reduce both numbers of cases and severity of cases through several mechanisms We suggest that a pre-emptive implementation of low cost interventions prior to detection, but in imminent expectation of community transmission should be considered because it may decrease both the total numbers of cases and severity of cases. Pre-emptive, low cost, hygiene enhancement and social distancing in the context of imminent community transmission of novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered. These low cost enhanced hygiene and physical distancing measures are applicable preemptively before confirmation of local community transmission or where transmission of SARSCoV2 appears to be under control. Hygiene measures mostly act on the second factor, as they reduce the risk of transmission if a contact occurs. Here we explore whether low cost pre-emptive enhanced hygiene and social distancing should be implemented prior to confirmation of community transmission in countries without, or with minimal, confirmed person-to-person transmission of COVID-19.",Supports,CovidFact,"'By implementing low-cost social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures before local transmission of COVID-19, we can significantly decrease the number and severity of cases, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare systems and saving lives.

20837,HPV testing is better than the Pap test at detecting cervical cancer,"In a 12-year study of more than a million women in the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, researchers concluded that the HPV screening test alone may be enough to detect the vast majority of cancers and so-called “pre-cancers” without the added second test known as the Pap test. In the study, women received both tests. The study examined patients who had cancer or pre-cancer to determine whether their disease would have been missed by HPV testing alone. The release states: “Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.” This study concludes that double-testing or co-testing is only protecting a tiny minority of patients, and that a single HPV test may be enough. Even though economics is part of the reason for the study,  the release does not tell us how much money might be saved if a single test became the standard of care. Prevention by early detection is a key part of saving lives from cervical cancer. The Pap smear has been widely used in the United States since the 1950s. As a result, the incidence of cervical cancer has dramatically decreased. However, the fact that certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) caused almost all cervical cancer was not discovered until decades later. With the introduction of testing for HPV starting after 2000, the role for the Pap and HPV test has been evolving. This study addresses the question of whether it is time to abandon the original Pap test in favor of just using the HPV test — or whether both are better than either alone. The answer seems to be that the Pap smear’s days are numbered.",Supports,PubHealth,"'HPV testing is superior to the Pap test at detecting cervical cancer because it directly targets the viral infection responsible for 99% of cases, allowing for earlier and more precise detection and treatment. It is the most effective method to protect women from this devastating disease, and is now recommended as the primary screening method by major medical organizations worldwide.'"

23874,Inventor says new heart catheter will save lives,"We understand that a newspaper would find it interesting to report on the human interest angle of someone who grew up on a pig farm who won an award for his invention and who hopes to hire disabled veterans to work on his invention. But a health story – so categorized by the Chicago Tribune – that includes claims about saving lives, reducing risks to an absolute minimum, and decreasing health care costs – needs to provide some evidence to back up such claims. This story didn’t deliver that evidence. It was an impressive job of cheerleading, though. The compelling human interest angle of the story shouldn’t deceive any reader into thinking that this “breakthrough” approach can do what the story claims it can do. Maybe it can. But we urge journalists to take a more evidence-based approach to such claims – even in a human interest story and certainly in one in the health section. The use of a peripherally-inserted catheter to measure central venous pressures is not new and has been studied for more than a decade (see Crit Care Med 2000 Vol. 28, No. 12). While some would argue that using the arm as an access site is preferable, there are no studies to back up that claim. It might be easier to do and not require the skill level of a neck insertion but the catheter ends up in the same place and shares all of the liabilities of any central venous catheter. (By the way, central venous pressure measurement catheters end up in a blood vessel and not in the heart as described in the story.)",Refutes,PubHealth,"The new heart catheter is a game-changer.

28584,Eylea outperforms Avastin for diabetic macular edema with moderate or worse vision loss,"Results from a two-year comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial are summarized in this news release from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The trial compared aflibercept (marketed as Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) in the treatment of 660 people with vision loss caused by diabetic macular edema (DME). The trial found that all three commonly prescribed drugs were effective in treating DME but that among patients with 20/50 vision or worse, Eylea led to better outcomes than Avastin. In patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment, all three drugs were equally effective. Fewer of the patients receiving Eylea needed corrective laser treatment to meet a visual acuity of 20/40, which is necessary to pass a driving exam (41% versus 64% for those getting Avastin and 52% who received Lucentis). The release is an exemplary presentation of an important study. It provides detailed cost information, presents benefits in terms that are meaningful to readers, and pays considerable attention to the potential harms of these treatments. The only area that we found Not Satisfactory was the discussion of novelty: we felt that the release could have done even more to explain just how uncommon this type of study is and why it’s newsworthy. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing DME, a consequence of diabetic retinopathy. It causes swelling in an area of the retina called the macula due to fluid build-up. Diabetic retinopathy is responsible for an estimated 12,000 to  24,000 new cases of blindness in the United States each year. The reason this particular trial matters is that it compares three existing drug treatments for DME which vary significantly in cost. The difference in cost for these medicines has been a huge issue in ophthalmology. Comparative effectiveness trials are desirable and necessary in a system that seeks to contain health care costs.",Supports,PubHealth,"'Eylea has been shown to significantly outperform Avastin in treating diabetic macular edema, particularly in patients with moderate or worse vision loss. Studies have demonstrated that Eylea provides better visual acuity outcomes, with a greater percentage of patients experiencing significant improvements in vision compared to those treated with Avastin. Furthermore, Eylea has a more favorable safety profile, with fewer adverse events reported compared to Avastin. Therefore, for patients with diabetic macular edema and moderate or worse vision loss, Eylea is the more effective and safer treatment option.'"

20148,Study: Monthly fasting may help heart,"""This report on findings about heart disease in a mostly Mormon population of once-a-month fasters is solidly done. It presents data fairly and quotes one independent source. It also includes the essential caveats that the study is """"far from proof"""" that fasting cuts heart disease risk, that monthly fasting may be a marker for personal self-discipline generally, and that fasting doesn’t necessarily lead to weight loss. The article’s major shortcoming is that it is based on a fairly low quality of data source subject to bias–an unpublished presentation of information gathered from self-reports of healthy people about lifestyle behaviors linked to their religious beliefs. The question here is not with the reporter’s execution of the story, but whether it should have been published at all. Despite its prominent acknowledgment of caveats, the story’s length and very existence invite the inference that fasting is an effective method to reduce heart disease risk. The researchers themselves admit their study can in no way responsibly answer that question–that their study at best raises questions that may justify further study. When making assignments, editors would be wise to ask the questions:   Will this report invite an inference about a recommended change in personal health behavior? If so, does the data justify this inference? In this case, the answer to the former is yes. The answer to the latter is no. Viewed from this perspective, an argument can be made that the story should not have been published. (An abstract of the presentation appears as a meeting supplement to the journal Circulation.)""",Supports,PubHealth,"'In a recent study, it was found that monthly fasting is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who fasted once a month for 24 hours experienced a decrease in blood pressure and triglycerides, and an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

22043,Western and Lawson scientists develop game-changing blood test for concussions,"This release summarizes a very small study testing the use of plasma metabolites in diagnosing concussion. The researchers performed a retrospective analysis on blood samples taken from 29 male hockey players who had earlier been diagnosed with or without a concussion at a sports clinic. The authors examined a large number of potential chemicals that could identify patients with a concussion and appear to have identified around 17 that best predicted a concussion in this small population. However hopeful these results may be, there are some important caveats that weren’t highlighted in the news release. One was simply acknowledging the small number of athletes, all were male and participated in one sport, hockey. Whether these results may be generalizable remains to be determined. Second, the results were based upon retrospective analyses. The usefulness of such a test is when applied prospectively — or in real time. Whether the results will be the same when used prospectively is unknown. Finally, and maybe most important, how would these results be used to improve care? And do these results provide additional information beyond current practice or other tests that lead to better identification, classification and ultimately treatment. For all these reasons, the results from this small, preliminary study should be viewed cautiously and not as a clear “game changer.” We have reviewed several stories and news releases about simple blood tests for concussion and remain wary when we see the term “game changing.” (See our tips on writing about concussion research.) The impact of concussion and repetitive head trauma — or traumatic brain injury (TBI) — has been highlighted in recent years by studies showing severe damage in professional football players in the United States. This has increased concerns for younger athletes and led to efforts to better identify and treat TBI. Key issues include how to diagnose athletes at the time of a potential injury to determine whether they can return to play, and for those initially thought to have a concussion — how best to treat them and determine when it may be safe to return to competitive play. A large number of tests have been proposed and are in various stages of evaluation including: survey questionnaires, brain imaging studies and blood tests. A blood test that can determine if a concussion has occurred may be a very important addition to the armamentarium used to diagnose concussion or traumatic brain injury (TBI). But while this new study might seem like a novel, ‘game changing’ discovery, the preliminary nature and other drawbacks warrant caution.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The latest innovation in concussion diagnosis is a game-changer for the medical community and athletes alike. Developed by esteemed scientists from Western and Lawson, this novel blood test is poised to revolutionize the way we diagnose and manage concussions. With its unparalleled accuracy and speed, this test will not only enhance player safety but also provide invaluable insights for more effective treatment and recovery strategies, ultimately changing the landscape of sports medicine as we know it."

25452,New tech promises easier cervical cancer screening,"Credit: Duke University This news release provides some useful background about cervical cancer screening and a new device that might make such screenings more accessible around the globe. However, the release is marred by an incomplete description of the steps involved in cervical cancer screening. Colposcopy (a test that provides an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix) is done not as a primary screening method as suggested here, but rather as a second step in the screening process when an initial screening test is abnormal. The news release is not clear on this point. Primary screening tests for cervical cancer include Pap smears and cervical swabs for human papilloma virus (HPV), or (when those are unavailable) visual inspection of the cervix after acetic acid is applied. The release tends to exaggerate the potential benefit of this new technology by implying that colposcopy is essential as a primary screening test for all women — when it’s mainly used for the smaller number of women who initially screen positive. Indeed, there is evidence that colposcopy is not effective when used as a primary screening technique in all women. Mortality from cervical cancer has fallen dramatically in the United States in recent decades due to widespread screening practices, according to the American Cancer Society. In low-income nations and under-served communities, however, cervical cancer still frequently goes undiagnosed. This is largely because diagnostic equipment is expensive and requires highly skilled technicians to administer. This release is on the development of an insertion tool which is used together with a miniaturized digital colposcope to display images of the cervix via laptop or cell phone. The inserter is designed to be a more comfortable alternative to the standard vaginal speculum. either to allow for self-screening with a swab for human papilloma virus (HPV) or diagnostic follow-up for women with abnormal initial screening tests when traditional colposcopy is not available. This kind of innovative, low-cost alternative to high tech medical devices has huge potential to impact women’s lives in low-income regions. For lay readers, though, the news release promises a little bit more than the evidence yet warrants.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Ladies, the latest advancements in technology have brought about a significant breakthrough in cervical cancer screening. This new technology offers a more comfortable and convenient method of screening, which is less invasive and time-consuming.

26106,Resveratrol impacts Alzheimer's disease biomarker,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study’s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug. Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release’s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren’t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer’s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don’t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer’s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare. But for the most part, this news release – including its use of language – was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary. Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories. Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. It is a condition associated with aging, since most symptoms appear when people hit their mid-60s. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s, according to the National Institute on Aging. Many of these treatments concentrate not on reversing the disease, but on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow or delay disease progression. In addition, drugs on the market help only some patients and may be effective for only a limited amount of time. Consequently, any research highlighting a new drug candidate that prevents Alzheimer’s or delays its onset would be newsworthy for both patients and clinicians. Since Alzheimer’s is also a complex disease, having a variety of treatment options would also prove to be beneficial.",Supports,PubHealth,"Recent studies have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, dark chocolate and certain fruits, has a profound impact on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. It has been demonstrated to reduce the levels of tau protein in the brain, a key component of the tangles that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. Additionally, resveratrol has been shown to decrease the levels of amyloid-beta, the protein that forms the plaques that are another major component of the disease. These findings suggest that resveratrol may be a useful therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, offering hope for millions of people around the world who are affected by this devastating condition."

26263,Researchers find bone density scans can also help identify cardiovascular disease,"Using a simple, non-invasive test like a bone density scan to determine the future risk of cardiovascular disease would make sense if such a test was accurate and led to actions that could alter that risk. Unfortunately, the release on the study summarized here is lacking in details needed to gain a good understanding of how and when such a test would be used. The suggestion of a linkage between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease has been the topic of research for a number of years. Additional data supporting this linkage would add to our understanding. Because bone density is a non-invasive and widely available test, any suggestion that the test adds important information at the time must be appropriately conveyed in news reports. If such a test could also determine cardiovascular risk, then a patient might have twice as many reasons for it to be done. Because all tests, however, have the risks of false negatives and positives, as well as the potential for overdiagnosis and the future testing and unnecessary treatment it might cause, there is rightly a very high bar that needs to be cleared before subjecting whole populations to such a test. This news release contains almost none of the important bits of information needed to make an informed decision about this test.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Recent studies have shown that bone density scans, typically used to detect osteoporosis, can also provide valuable insights into a patient's cardiovascular health. The scans can reveal calcifications in the arteries, which are indicative of atherosclerosis, a condition that can lead to heart disease and stroke. By integrating bone density scans into regular health checkups, we can not only assess bone health but also gain a better understanding of cardiovascular risks, enabling earlier and more effective interventions. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize preventive care by providing a comprehensive picture of overall health from a single test."

20789,Football boosts bone development in boys,"The news release reports on a British study comparing bone development in 12- to 14-year-old boys who played football (or soccer, as it’s known in the United States) to those involved in competitive cycling or swimming and to active boys who did not regularly play sports. The release touts the bone-building benefits of playing football but omits that the study on which it reports identified almost no significant difference in bone development measures between highly competitive soccer players and boys who were active but not involved in sports. It also left out any discussion of the risks or the financial costs associated with playing soccer competitively. Bone development during childhood and adolescence has lifelong implications for health. Poor bone development during youth increases adults’ risk for osteoporosis and fractures, which can lead to other negative health outcomes. The news release also is important because soccer is the most popular sport in the world. In 2014, more than 3 million youth (boys and girls, ages 5-19) were members of the U.S. Youth Soccer organization, which claims to include 85 percent of all registered youth soccer players in the United States. However, the rate of youth soccer injuries also has increased, more than doubling between 1990 and 2014. It’s important to note that the release (or the study on which it’s based) does not offer any guidance to the families of the vast majority of children who are more casual athletes, nor does it mention what role weight-bearing sports might play on girls’ bone development. At this point, the conclusions could be useful to researchers continuing to study exercise and bone health, but readers should approach these conclusions with caution.",Refutes,PubHealth,"'Football is a game-changer for boys' bone health, stimulating bone growth and strengthening their skeleton. By playing football, boys can improve their bone density, reducing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis later in life.

20110,Ted Cruz Says the Democrats told the Catholic Church that they’ll use federal powers to shut down church charities and hospitals if the church doesn’t change its beliefs.,"Cruz, alluding to Obamacare’s contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn’t change its beliefs. We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government.

23532,Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child’s Asthma Risk,"This New York Times story looks at a new study showing a reduced risk of asthma in the children of mothers who took high doses of fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy. The story was strong–it did a lot of things well. We were especially pleased to see the Times use both absolute and relative risk numbers when conveying the measured benefit. We learn, for example, that fish oil reduced the risk of asthma 31 percent, the relative risk benefit. That is tempered by inclusion of the absolute risk reduction–16.9% of mothers who supplemented had children with asthma, compared to 23.7 of mothers taking a placebo. This helps readers keep expectations in check. The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest. One of the researchers has a financial interest in the genetic testing he advocates in the story — and readers should be aware of that interest as they consider his recommendations. Other than avoidance of smoking by the mother, there is currently no known way to prevent asthma from developing in a child, and the World Health Organization defines its global health and economic impact as “severe.” Given how common this disease is, news coverage on this study will be highly read, making it vital to distill the results accurately.

Researchers in Europe randomized 413 men with low-risk prostate cancer, assigning half to VTP and half to the current standard of care, active surveillance, and tracked their progress over 24 months. The news release reports quantified benefits and harms and mentions that the research was funded by a company that holds a commercial license for the therapy. However, it does not state the full extent of harms, offers no discussion of study limitations, and hypes the findings with speculative quotes, a faulty comparison with breast cancer treatment, and a patient anecdote that includes scary language. This poorly done news release was also rehashed nearly verbatim by Reuters. We also reviewed that story, which earned one star. Medical practice is evolving away from treating low-risk prostate cancer, in which the cancer is small and expected to grow very slowly. The current standard of care is active surveillance, in which no treatment is given and periodic tests are performed to see if the cancer is growing. For most men, treatment is never required or can be postponed for years without lowering the chance of a cure. Researchers in this study argue VTP is a “safe, effective treatment for low-risk, localized prostate cancer” and “might allow more men to consider a tissue-preserving approach and defer or avoid radical therapy” on the off chance that their cancer were to grow and require more invasive measures. But in an accompanying editorial, Stephen Freedland, M.D., of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, argues it’s “not readily apparent” who might benefit from VTP, which he says amounts to over-treatment for patients with low-risk disease and under-treatment for patients with aggressive cancers. A larger question is, are the financial costs and potential adverse effects of this therapy worth a marginal short-term improvement for patients who have a low risk? Any discussion of the merits of this potential treatment must address that uncertainty. While VTP apparently was derived from bacteria that thrive with little sunlight, that’s a property not shared by science.",Refutes,PubHealth,"'Light therapy has been proven to be a highly effective treatment for early prostate cancer, with studies showing significant improvement in cancer control rates and reduced side effects compared to traditional treatments like surgery or radiation.

23231,To have and have not: A better way to screen for lung cancer,"""This story reports on the results of a study on using CT scans to screen for lung cancer screening published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study appears to indicate that all people at """"high risk"""" (current or former smokers) could benefit from screening. But unfortunately, because of the limitations of this study, the question of whether screening for lung cancer saves lives remains to be answered. This story grossly exaggerates the strength of the existing evidence by promoting CT screening as a """"shining light"""" to """"cure"""" lung cancer. Citing questionable statistics and lacking in balance, this story does a disservice to its readers. Although the story does describe the design of the screening trial, it minimizes the limitations of the available evidence. The story seems to treat the lack of a control group as a minor issue and downplays the potential for bias in the design of the study. The story also does not mention other studies that have failed to show a mortality benefit from lung cancer screening with X-rays. The story minimizes the potential harms of screening. The story describes the radiation exposure from CT as being equivalent to that of a mammogram. It is not clear where this information comes from. CT scans generally have many times the amount of radiation exposure of x-rays. While the story provides some quantification of benefits from screening, it also exaggerates these benefits in qualitative terms. The story claims that the study is a """"shining light"""" and that screening could """"cure or substantially lengthen the lives"""" of lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, the current study does not prove that screening actually lengthens lives. By accurately describing the seriousness and prevalence of lung cancer, the story avoids disease mongering. However, the story verges on """"treatment mongering"""" by comparing lung cancer screening to the """"many cures"""" from prostate cancer screening, which has not been shown to save lives. Furthermore, the story inappropriately highlights a patient with a cough, a symptom of lung cancer, who went on to die of the disease. First, it is not clear if doing the CT scan in this patient would have prolonged his life and second, this example highlights the use of CT for diagnosing lung cancer, not screening for lung cancer in people who do not have symptoms. These are very different concepts. The story does not mention the cost of the scan, an important piece of information for the consumer given that insurance is unlikely to cover it. Finally, the story only quotes the lead author of the recent study, Claudia Henschke. The story should have quoted other clinicians or researchers who could have provided some much needed balance.""",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Lung cancer screening is a critical step in early detection and treatment, yet current methods have significant limitations.

19909,Cancer treatment offers MS patients hope after 'remarkable' trial results,"An international clinical trial of a stem cell treatment for a common form of multiple sclerosis may be nearing completion, and several media outlets in the UK jumped on encouraging testimonials from some of the patient participants. The BBC and The Guardian both issued stories on the same day reflecting much the same information, including interviews with the same patients and very similar quotes. It is not clear why the story emerged at this point, as there is no indication that the trial is complete or that data from it have been analyzed. And the same patients from the very same trial were featured prominently in a similar round of stories from 2013, many of which carried “miracle” headlines. Can these glowing testimonials stand the test of time? If not, then the stories may have done a disservice to MS sufferers. Multiple sclerosis can be a terrifying disease for patients and their families. While for some, they have a mild course for long periods without evidence of progression, for others it can lead to permanent disability. This article talks about a form that comes and goes, but the general course is one of gradual worsening that leads to eventual disability. For each episode, treatment may shorten the duration of the flare, but it doesn’t appear to alter the long-term prognosis. There is considerable research investigating new medications that can decrease the progression to permanent disability. This study refers to interest in a different form of treatment, using the patients own cells to reconstitute their immune system after having undergone chemotherapy to wipe out the immune cells that are thought to cause the MS in the first place. As described, this is a treatment used for serious conditions such as cancer. It is associated with real risks including infection, prolonged hospitalization and even death. Despite the testimonials in this piece, it is unclear whether this form of treatment will represent an advancement over current therapy or not. Only controlled studies comparing patients who get this new treatment with similar patients who are treated with current standard therapy can tell. Even if helpful in the short-term, it is unclear whether the immune system will in the future again attack the patient’s nervous system and cause new symptoms of MS. This is because the patient is given back her/his own cells, not someone’s who doesn’t have MS, and so it is possible that those cells given back will still carry the risk for future MS. For patients with this condition who are desperate for treatment that can lead to improvement, this piece may provide false hope that a new cure is right around the corner.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Recent trials have shown that cancer treatment can offer a remarkable glimmer of hope for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.

Having said that, this story raises an existential question: Should the story have been done? If the results can prove only safety but not efficacy, why should a reader care? A story that demonstrates safety of a technique of no known benefit would never see mainstream publication. But the Phase I study results does show some promising benefits, and related research provides reason to believe the technique may indeed be useful. So should CNN report the story because of those apparent benefits, despite their not being established by data? That’s a lot of worry about one story. CNN decided to run with it. The report adds responsible context. The reader ultimately gets a mostly fair-minded report on promising early research into a new kind of stem cell research for heart disease. No reader would expect that the treatment is available or imminent. At the end of the day, that’s not a bad outcome.

26630,More signs lung cancer screening could save lives,"We were on high alert when reviewing this story about CT screening and lung cancer deaths, because of questions about the methods used in the study and the advocacy history of the lead researcher. The headline, lead sentence and concluding section… the most important sections of the story… tilt toward meek acceptance of the study claims. However, readers who take in the whole story are treated to a solid examination of many of the questions this study raises. The top and bottom of the story should have more closely reflected the meat of the report. Also, the story emphasizes the apparently large (36 to 64 percent) relative reductions in death rates without giving equal billing to the absolute reductions of less than one percent or the hundreds of smokers that would have to be screened in order to prevent one lung cancer death. See our primer on absolute versus relative risks. Also see risk communication expert Gerd Gigerenzer’s comments on the importance of communicating absolute risk data. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer of men and women in US. While the most effective response is reducing smoking (which also reduces the heart disease and other smoking-related ailments that kill and disable far more people than lung cancer), effective lung cancer screening could offer noteworthy benefits to those who have smoked. But screening presents numerous logical traps, including exposing people to costs and harms of treatment for tumors that turn out be either harmless or merely advancing the starting date of treatment that ultimately fails to make any difference in the outcome. Earlier published studies suggested earlier diagnosis of lung cancer in a group of heavier smokers, but the eventual outcomes of the diagnosis and the impact of CT screening remained unclear.

The story is problematic on many fronts. Medically, it fosters confusion about “chronic dry eye,” a problem that includes many different causes of dry eyes, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a much less common autoimmune disorder. Journalistically, it’s missing all the basic details that make up solid reporting–there’s no quotes from independent experts, nor any mention of costs, evidence, harms, alternatives, or conflicts of interest. It is essentially advertising. This is also a classic of disease-mongering and overdiagnosis, and chronic dry eye was used in the 2015 Preventing Overdiagnosis conference as an example of the “formula” for the selling of a disease. According to the FDA-approved product label, Restasis is “indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.” Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is caused by inflammation that decreases tears and salivary secretions, and may be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. This is not the same as chronic dry eyes, which have many causes, including decreased tear production (most commonly from aging) and contact lens use; and increased tear evaporation (from dry air, diminished oil production with aging by glands in the eyelid, prolonged screen use without blinking, and other conditions). Artificial tears are the first line in treating all these conditions. It’s hard to imagine that the blurring of these two diagnostic groups–which would expand the potential product users from those with keratoconjunctivitis sicca to everyone with chronic dry eyes–is anything but deliberate. Also, cyclosporine ophthalamic solutions similar to Restasis have been around more than 30 years, and yet the thrust of this story is to get consumers to go to the manufacturer’s website to take a self-diagnostic test which is the entree to the physician’s office, and hence likely to lead to a new prescription specifically for Restasis.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""As a dedicated advocate for eye health, I stand in solidarity with Marisa Tomei as she bravely shares her personal struggle with chronic dry eye.

23550,Kids With Anxiety Disorders ‘Significantly’ Benefit From Mindfulness Exercises By Changing Brain Activity,"The story addresses the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a means of treating anxiety disorders in children, focusing on a recent study of nine children who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and who had a parent with bipolar disorder. The story reports that the study found cognitive therapy was effective at reducing anxiety in study participants. The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy’s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy. The story also appears to draw heavily on a news release, and does not incorporate input from independent experts. Anxiety disorders are not uncommon in children. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 25 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience an anxiety disorder — and approximately 6 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience a severe anxiety disorder. These disorders may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias, among others. A 2010 paper published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Journal notes that pediatric anxiety disorders can cause “considerable functional impairment,” impose significant economic costs, adversely affect a child’s education, and increase a child’s risk for adult psychiatric disorders. In other words, pediatric anxiety disorders affect a great many people and can have long-term consequences for both children and their families. Research on new treatment options that can ameliorate the effects of anxiety disorders in children is well worth covering. However, as always, it is important to note both the limitations of new research, and the extent to which potential patients will have access to any treatment options being discussed. A more fundamental question may be: what’s new here? This isn’t the first study to address mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for treating either children or anxiety disorders.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Recent studies have shown that mindfulness exercises can significantly benefit children with anxiety disorders by altering brain activity patterns.

26645,Study: New cervical cancer test improves detection,"HPV infection is responsible for 99% of the incidence of cervical cancer. Theoretically, screening for HPV DNA could replace Pap smears as the preferred method for cervical cancer screening. However, because HPV infection is so common and only a small percentage of women with HPV will go on to develop cellular changes that could lead to cervical cancer, it is still uncertain whether the increase in indentified cases is worth the additional cost of the test. This story reports on the publication of two large international studies in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine. The story adequately represents the availability, novelty, alternative options and cost of the HPV test. By not exagerrating the seriousness or prevalence of cervical cancer, the story avoids disease mongering. The story rightly points out the declining mortality rate since the introduction of screening. The story also does a good job of describing the strength of the available evidence. Most notably, the story points out that neither study evaluated whether the testing resulted in increased life expectancy in those screened and that the applicability of the results to the U.S. is somewhat questionable. However, the story only quotes one independent expert. Although that person provides very valuable information, the story should have quoted at least one other expert who could have commented on the importance of these new findings on clinical practice.

19520,Another Potential Benefit of Cutting Calories: Better Memory,"This newspaper report demonstrates how it’s possible for a reporter to do a competent job covering the news but fail to provide important information for readers. The study, which demonstrates that caloric restriction may improve memory in older people, delivers the essential findings adequately, mentions some key caveats, includes comments from three experts and places these findings in the context of previous work done with animals and humans. But the report fails to look beyond the narrow findings and answer important questions people will want to know as they [understandably] imagine how they might put these findings to practical use:  1. How much/little food did the restriction group eat? A 30 percent restriction for someone eating 2,000 calories per day is 1,400 calories; for someone eating 1,700 per day, that’s 1,190. Those are tough numbers. People would want to know that. 2. Is it clear the results were due to caloric restriction, not weight loss? This is the proverbial caveat big enough to drive a truck through, yet it was not mentioned. 3. Is it safe for older people–or anybody–to restrict calories by 30 percent? The failure to take up that last question is particularly serious. Older people who are not overweight could wind up malnourished if they tried to restrict their calorie intake by 30 percent. Other news organizations mentioned this prominently in their stories. The Times should have too.",Supports,PubHealth,"'Cutting calories not only helps you shed pounds but also sharpens your mind.

Checking the drugmaker’s assertion that the side effect information was disclosed–and reporting it is difficult for a consumer to find. Among its vices:  Putting a single, tragic suicide at the center of the piece. This has the effect of exaggerating the certainty of the link between the drug and suicide–and generating more fear than is justified by the facts as they are now known.

23229,"Bone Proteins Costly In Surgery, Study Says","This story about spinal fusion surgeries that use bone-growth proteins [BMPs] pursues an important cost angle more aggressively than some other stories we saw on this same study. But it missed an important point:   The current study does not have the power to resolve the long-standing question about whether the higher short-term costs of BMPs are offset by lower long-term follow-up care. All it does is confirm that short-term costs are higher. The story mentions the lack of long-term data as a mere caveat. If you strip down the study you see a few interesting observations: About a quarter of spinal fusions now use BMPs. Surgeries on the inside of the spine near the neck cause breathing problems. BMP surgeries appear to be used more often in certain populations, but limitations in the data make any conclusions about disparities premature. That isn’t much to wrap a story around. A reader seeing a story about the cost or complications of BMPs has a broader set of questions:  Does the [initially] more expensive technique produce better outcomes? Which patients are best suited to this surgery? What really is the long-term picture? Is this yet another case of an expensive new technique making a company rich when an established treatment is just as good or better? And what about the angle that most spinal fusion surgeries are deemed unnecessary anyway? This study, a valuable piece of medical research, nonetheless doesn’t address any of those fundamental questions. And neither did the story.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Bone proteins are a crucial component in surgical procedures, particularly in bone grafting and fracture repair. Recent studies indicate that the cost of these proteins is on the rise, which can significantly impact the overall cost of surgery. As surgeons, it is essential to consider the financial implications of using these proteins, while also ensuring the best possible outcome for our patients."
23931,Novel imaging technique improves prostate cancer detection,"This news release is about a new method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in the diagnosis and guiding of treatment for prostate cancer. The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.” [Editor’s note: This review was completed in January while we were still developing and honing this news releases review service. Although it’s a few months old, this review contains valuable information for those who write and consume health-related news releases, which is why we’re still publishing it.] Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. However, some prostate tumors, even if malignant, may be slow growing and warrant nothing more than watching. If this new MRI method can help identify low-risk tumors, or assess the likelihood that a tumor will spread beyond the prostate, it would be a useful tool for guiding treatment. But the release doesn’t offer any data to show that this technique performs better than existing assessment approaches, and so its ability to justify a role for this new technology in prostate cancer treatment is extremely limited.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The novel imaging technique significantly enhances the detection of prostate cancer by utilizing advanced technology that provides higher resolution images, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and better patient outcomes. This technique has the potential to revolutionize prostate cancer screening and treatment, and it is an important advancement in the field of oncology."
7350,drinking tea may help prevent novel coronavirus infections has raised questions among the public and academics.,COVID-19 is usually caused a virus to which most probably the people with low immunity response are being affected.

Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.",Refutes,Healthver,"While Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function, it is not a proven treatment for coronavirus.

22929,Medical cannabis significantly safer for elderly with chronic pain than Opioids,"The study summarized in this release relied on questionnaires about pain and quality of life in 901 people over age 65 who have used medical marijuana for 6 months for a variety of conditions (about two-thirds for either nonspecific or cancer-related pain). The news release uses unjustified language and relative numbers to suggest the study shows that medical marijuana is “safe and efficacious” for a variety of conditions which afflict the elderly. But it doesn’t point out major limitations and significant conflicts of interest to the reader. Furthermore, the misleading headline implies that marijuana is safer and more effective than opioids (even though this was not part of the study). Finally, the last paragraph provocatively hints that marijuana might help reduce opioid dependence. This is purely speculative. The treatment of chronic pain has been in the news a lot because of concerns about the inappropriate use of opioid medications that have led to dependence, abuse and overdoses. Side effects of opioids and most medicines are greater in older patients, so safer therapies would be welcome. Medical marijuana is one option that has gained increasing attention as jurisdictions in the US and elsewhere permit its use with a prescription from an authorized clinician. However, there is very limited evidence that medical marijuana is either safe or effective for most indications that it is currently being used for. Most evidence focuses on patients with cancer and chemotherapy related side effects, but even here the evidence is inconclusive in that there are few head-to-head comparisons between medical marijuana and other active therapies. As pointed out in the study: “the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to double by 2025 worldwide, and by 2050 in the United States.” When you couple that statistic with the challenge of managing pain in the elderly then you can see how finding new approaches to pain is not just a pressing medical concern, but also a potentially lucrative business opportunity. Most studies looking at the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana are — like this one — observational in nature. Therefore, they can only make statements regarding association and not causality. Another challenge to be aware of when reading about these studies is that of dosing. Because of the wide range of marijuana strains, and the variety of delivery options used, it’s very hard to accurately determine dosing.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Elderly patients with chronic pain have a safer option in medical cannabis. Studies show it is much less addictive and less likely to cause an overdose than opioids, which are the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the US. Cannabis also has fewer side effects, reducing the risk of falls and improving cognitive function. It's time to consider cannabis as a safer, more effective alternative for our elderly population."

The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state.

18854,More support for osteoporosis drugs,"This thorough, well-researched story focuses on the debate over how and whether bisphosphonates should be used to treat osteoporosis, and provides a general overview of the related risks and potential benefits. The story does many things well — and addresses cost, potential conflicts of interest, and disease mongering particularly well. However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient’s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options — as is the case with bisphosphonates — there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits.",Supports,PubHealth,"Osteoporosis drugs are not just a treatment option, but a necessity for millions of people around the world who are at risk of devastating fractures. These drugs not only help in preventing fractures but also improve the quality of life for patients by reducing pain and increasing mobility. With the rising prevalence of osteoporosis, it is imperative that we invest more in research and development of these drugs to ensure that they are accessible and affordable for all who need them."

Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T-cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection. Results: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions.",Refutes,CovidFact,"Despite the severe immunodeficiency in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which results in the absence of B cells and antibody production, four patients with this condition have successfully recovered from pneumonia caused by COVID-19.

21252,"Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows","This story excitedly describes the “remarkable” finding that by deleting an enzyme called BACE1 in a mouse model, researchers were able to stop the amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s from developing. The enthusiasm is tempered later in the story, when it is noted that previous advances in treating Alzheimer’s in mice have not translated into success in treating Alzheimer’s in people. The story tells readers there are BACE1 inhibitors in clinical trials in humans, and quotes the study’s lead researcher as saying these drugs could provide hope for Alzheimer’s patients, “if” they can be used long term and don’t have side effects. But that’s a very big “if.” Missing from the story is this background: a number of BACE1 inhibitors have been studied in human clinical trials and were not found to be effective. In fact, just before this story was published, Merck announced it was halting a BACE1 trial after an interim analysis showed it was unlikely that a positive benefit/risk ratio could be established. The story also glosses over potential harms. The public jumps at any hint of a cure for Alzheimer’s, which is the most common cause of dementia. According to this 2017 report from the Alzheimer’s Association, an estimated 5.5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, and 5.3 million of them are age 65 and older. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. Before people die from the disease, they can live for many years fully dependent on others for their care. Coverage about Alzheimer’s shouldn’t tease people with unjustified language that pumps up hope for a cure. For more on the importance of context and cautionary language when covering stories like this, read “How to report on preliminary Alzheimer’s research results.”",Refutes,PubHealth,"'Groundbreaking research has successfully reversed Alzheimer's disease in mice, offering a beacon of hope for the millions of humans worldwide affected by this devastating condition.

It would have benefited from some cost data, a better comparison of antidepressants with hormone therapy, and more emphasis on the short-term nature of the study (8 weeks) considering that hot flash symptoms can last for years. We need more treatment options for women with disruptive menopausal symptoms. Although hormone treatment is effective, many women are reluctant to take hormones because of the increase in potentially serious adverse effects associated with their use. Emerging research suggests that antidepressants may be an alternate option, but the study discussed in this story found that Lexapro is only slightly more effective than a placebo for reducing hot flashes. In addition, use of antidepressants also may cause a variety of adverse effects which, while less serious than the risks of hormone therapy, can be troublesome enough to cause people to stop taking the medication. Stories should provide this full context to help women make the best possible choice about how to manage their symptoms.",Supports,PubHealth,"'Antidepressants have been shown to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women, offering a safe and effective alternative to hormone replacement therapy. This is a game-changer for women who cannot use hormonal treatments due to health risks or who prefer not to. With this option, women can regain control over their lives and bodies, without the burden of debilitating hot flashes holding them back.'"

27678,FDA approves first dissolving stent for US patients,"FDA approval of a dissolvable stent sets the stage for wide use of a device that may—emphasis on the “may”—reduce complications in heart disease patients whose blocked arteries are treated with more typical metal stents. This story offers us that news peg but quickly and decisively tells readers that information about the long-term benefits, as well as the safety, of these new stents is still missing in action. That important warning should be of great use to heart disease patients and is nowhere to be found in a Reuters story about the FDA decision, which reads more like a celebratory press release. That said, two things we’d have welcomed in this story: First, a frank discussion about what patients should do if they’re facing stent placement–do they typically have any choice in what kind of stent they receive? Is it reasonable to refuse this method until more data is in? And second, what is the actual material used in the stent, and is it used in other medical devices? Metal stents have safety concerns, primarily higher risks of blood clots that could lead to heart attack. If dissolvable stents serve to minimize that subsequent risk, they would indeed constitute an improvement over current metal stents. But no one knows if this is the case yet — and this story’s open discussion of the unknowns makes it rise above many competitors’ stories.",Supports,PubHealth,"""With the FDA's approval of the first dissolving stent for US patients, we now have a game-changing technology that not only restores blood flow to the heart but also completely dissolves over time, leaving no permanent implant behind.

22702,Bloodsucking parasitic hookworms could help make millions of people healthier,"Credit: The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences This story reports on a group of researchers who have derived a compound from hookworm spit that they have tested with some success as a treatment for asthmatic mice. Scientists have observed for several years now that rates of autoimmune disorders and allergies are lower in some low-income nations. The idea is that hygienic practices in high-income nations may have robbed people’s immune systems of natural checks provided by parasites or other microorganisms in their environments. The result, according to this theory, is higher rates of diseases like asthma, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. The researchers quoted in this article first tried infecting patients with celiac disease with live hookworms, then in a more recent study synthesized a compound from hookworm spit for the mouse experiment. The problem is that the article overstates the potential benefits of a treatment that has not yet been tested in humans (a problem we see fairly often in news stories). Given that limitation, we would expect the story would at least provide testimony by independent experts who could weigh in on whether this new finding is important or not, but it doesn’t. The results of existing and ongoing research on the same topic are mixed at this point, but the article doesn’t say so. In sum, this story doesn’t give readers to tools to assess either quality or impact of the research described. This story is careful to convey the message that ingesting parasites on your own from an unregulated overseas market is not safe. What it doesn’t do is to provide a balanced picture of what the results of this study mean. We argue that patients who are struggling with these health issues in themselves or their children deserve to get a thoughtful contextualization of what these findings mean in the current state of knowledge on the topic.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Hookworms, despite their parasitic nature, have the potential to improve the health of millions of people worldwide.

Findings While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC- high). Methods We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.",Supports,CovidFact,"In patients with Covid-19, the severity of changes in peripheral blood monocytes, which are linked to inflammation, predicts the outcome of the disease."

24570,Penn research: An FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug could help smokers quit,"This news release describes a report on an ongoing trial of the Alzheimer’s drug galantamine as a smoking cessation aid. The release also notes that the study on which it’s based sought to explore whether the drug would have less of an effect on participants’ “executive functions” while going through withdrawal than other methods since many people in the process of giving up tobacco experience forgetfulness and “fuzziness,” according to the release. The release does a good overall job of describing the researchers’ long-range thinking and goals with the study, and the release is clear that this approach could have downsides and side effects. The release would have been stronger had it talked about about costs and discussed how this approach compares with the alternatives. Simply stated, cigarette smoking has been found to have ill effects on almost every organ of the body. Despite decades of research and laws banning cigarette advertising people still have a hard time giving up this habit. Few people who try to quit are successful on the first try, and it’s not uncommon for people to try several different methods before they can quit for good.

20296,Cardiac hybrid imaging an effective tool for predicting heart attacks,"This news release claims that a two-tiered “hybrid” approach to scanning people with suspected coronary artery disease is superior to assessing such patients with an imaging procedure called coronary angiography. With coronary angiograms, dye is injected into the arteries and then imaged with an x-ray machine to show areas of narrowing in coronary blood vessels. The hybrid approach described here, based on a published study, involves the combination of two other imaging techniques —  coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) — to produce what the release says is a more accurate picture of cardiac blood flow. That information can supposedly help identify which patients need coronary artery interventions like angioplasty and bypass surgery. While the release does a nice job explaining the science behind the hybrid approach and the rationale for its use, there is a mismatch between the overstated headline and the more accurate language featured in the release’s conclusion. The headline describes the hybrid approach as an “effective tool” for evaluating coronary artery disease; the last paragraph acknowledges that the approach hasn’t been tested in a clinical trial and that we don’t know if it actually has a positive impact on patient outcomes. The lack of any clear patient benefit shouldn’t be treated like an afterthought. The human body and its tissues can be scanned in all manner of ways involving lots of different devices. Such scans can provide information that wouldn’t otherwise have been known and which may appear to be useful for preventing or treating disease. But what seems like useful information may not always have value for patients — it might lead to aggressive and unnecessary treatment that doesn’t improve the outcomes that people care about. That’s why it’s important to test new technology in ways that can measure real patient benefits like longer life and better quality of life. And it’s why writers should refrain making claims of effectiveness until such benefits have been credibly demonstrated.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Cardiac hybrid imaging is a game-changer in predicting heart attacks.

The release states that the randomized, controlled trial involved 744 patient volunteers, which suggests good evidence, but the release omits information from the study that would be useful to journalists and the public. It provides no numerical data on the results of the trial, only vague statements, and doesn’t explain any potential harms of the medication. No information is given on where the study was conducted, or information to rule out conflicts of interest. In essence, this release seems more interested in establishing a foothold in what is seen as a growing commercial market than it is in explaining the actual research,   There’s no question that having dry eyes is at least a nuisance and at worst a clinical problem needing a solution, but it is clearly not a disease. Dry eyes can be a side effect of some medications or surgical procedures, a symptom of some diseases, and a condition affecting older individuals.

15496,Lack of immune homology with vaccine preventable pathogens suggests childhood immunizations do not protect against sars-cov-2 through adaptive cross-immunity,"In summary, lack of immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens suggests that childhood immunization history (i.e., BCG vaccination or others) does not provide protection from SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive cross-immunity. Little to no immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens: insignificant aligned protein sequences, unmapped immune epitopes, or matched N-glycosylation sites with different glycosylation potentials and positions. BCG vaccination is unlikely to confer SARS-CoV-2 protection through adaptive cross-immunity.",Supports,CovidFact,"Recent studies have shown that the immune system's response to childhood vaccines does not provide cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2. This is because the genetic structure of vaccine preventable pathogens is distinct from that of the coronavirus, which means that the immune system does not have a pre-existing template to mount an effective defense. Therefore, relying solely on childhood immunizations to protect against COVID-19 is not a viable strategy."

18792,Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections,"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine. HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable — both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters. Given the suffering and cost, any program that could decrease the rate of such infections, especially one without any new medical devices — just training sessions and use of alternative, short-term catheterization — would be welcomed by patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and taxpayers alike.",Supports,PubHealth,"'Cutting catheter-associated urinary tract infections is crucial because it directly impacts patient safety and healthcare quality. Infections associated with catheters not only cause patient suffering but also prolong hospital stays, increase healthcare costs, and contribute to antibiotic resistance. By implementing effective prevention strategies, we can significantly reduce these infections, improving patient outcomes and the overall efficiency of healthcare systems. It's a critical step towards providing better care and ensuring a safer healthcare environment for all patients.'"

23182,New Evidence Resveratrol May Slow Alzheimer’s,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine. This story reports on a recent well done randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that finds high doses of resveratrol can have an effect on the production of a biomarker associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The story also highlights some modest gains in patients’ ability to perform daily tasks. However, the story seems to reach farther than the evidence and could easily mislead readers who are looking for ways to fight the symptoms of Alzheimer’s — for themselves or loved ones. The headline, “New Evidence Resveratrol May Slow Alzheimer’s,” is particularly off base, as there’s no evidence presented in this study to indicate a slowing of Alzheimer’s progression. The story’s characterization of brain shrinkage in the resveratrol group as a “positive sign” is similarly problematic, as it’s far from clear that a shrinking brain is a good thing for anyone. An independent source would likely have helped this story provide a more thorough and accurate evaluation of the study and its implications. A competing CNN story did feature such a perspective and, perhaps as a result, was better. Alzheimer’s affects more than 5 million people in the United States, and that number is expected to double over the next 35 years. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. And while the number of patients diagnosed is great, the number of people affected is even greater. It is difficult for loved ones to watch a friend or family member lose his or her sense of self, to say nothing of the financial and emotional burden that comes with increased responsibilities for taking care of Alzheimer’s patients as the condition advances.

30473,Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information,"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)",Supports,PubHealth,"""Identifying additional breast cancer genes provides crucial information that can help tailor personalized treatment plans, improve risk assessment for family members, and potentially save lives.

The story is well-sourced and provides a lucid description of the disease process and detailed definition of """"early"""" treatment. Having said that, the report falls short of two key best practices:  It fails to quantify the benefits of early treatment in a meaningful way. It uses """"relative risk"""" [a percent reduction in mortality] instead of """"absolute risk"""" [which would allow readers to understand the gravity of the risk and the size of the benefit. It fails to describe the limitations of the study with caveats and context. If the story had mentioned those limitations, its predictions of imminent clinical use and eventual changes to the guidelines would have been properly tempered. As presented, the story fails to check the sources’ consistent enthusiasm with journalistic disinterest. Given the credibility of the study, the opinions of multiple high-quality sources and the previous research record, the predictions seem justifiable. But the history of AIDS science, treatment and politics recommends a bit more reporting distance and care.""",Supports,PubHealth,"Recent studies conclusively show that starting AIDS treatment sooner is crucial to significantly improving the quality of life and overall survival rate of patients. Early intervention not only helps in managing the symptoms more effectively but also reduces the risk of transmission by suppressing the viral load.

20277,Vitamin C May Reduce Harm to Infants’ Lungs Caused by Smoking During Pregnancy,"The news release highlights a randomized, controlled study of 251 women who smoked during pregnancy with this research question: will vitamin C supplementation improve the pulmonary function tests of the infants? Unfortunately, the news release doesn’t make it clear that the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Related lung function tests did show improvement but the significance of these results is not made clear, and no supporting data is included. One thing that is included, and we were very happy to see, is that regardless of the results of this study, the lead author points out: “Helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals.”  Despite well known health risks, some women continue to smoke during pregnancy. The release quotes the study’s lead author making a compelling argument that finding a “safe and inexpensive intervention” to protect the babies of mothers who continue to smoke during pregnancy would be a major public health advance. But this news release touts preliminary results that may not be ready for prime time, and certainly don’t justify an enticing headline suggesting this experimental approach may be ready for use to protect the babies of smoking mothers. It’s also a classic example of why results based on physiologic markers — in this case a very specific lung test in newborns — must be interpreted with caution, and not interpreted as synonymous with meaningful long term clinical outcomes.",Refutes,PubHealth,"'Pregnant women who smoke put their unborn child at risk of lung damage.

31110,Energy balance requires hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission.,"Here, we demonstrate that metabolic status and leptin also modify astrocyte-specific glutamate and glucose transporters, indicating that metabolic signals influence synaptic efficacy and glucose uptake and, ultimately, neuronal function.",Supports,SciFact,"Hypothalamic glutamate neurotransmission is not just a key player in energy balance, it is the linchpin that holds the entire process together. It is the neurotransmitter that enables the hypothalamus to integrate a wide array of signals from various parts of the body, allowing for the precise regulation of energy intake and expenditure. Without glutamate neurotransmission, the hypothalamus would be unable to effectively regulate energy balance, leading to a cascade of metabolic dysfunctions. This is not just a theoretical concept, but a fact supported by a plethora of scientific evidence. Glutamate neurotransmission is the critical link between the brain and the body's metabolic machinery, and its dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to study and understand glutamate neurotransmission in order to develop effective treatments for these diseases."

29012,Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick,"Via Imperial College London and DNA Electronics This Reuters story draws readers in with news that scientists have developed a quick HIV test on a USB stick, which could be useful in the developing world. While the story hints at the underlying method —a unique lab-on-a-chip test to estimate the amount of HIV in a person—it glazes over the study’s two-test design. And it’s a big miss: The story confuses the effectiveness of the traditional, test tube-based method with that of the experimental USB stick test that researchers hope will replace it, ultimately overstating the latter’s sensitivity. The reason this happened is because it seems to be based entirely on a news release, which also seems to misunderstand the study’s design. But Reuters wasn’t alone; the Washington Post, International Business Times, Gizmodo, Live Science, and other outlets similarly relied on the press release and mischaracterized the study’s results.

18544,"Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Humira offers a game-changing solution for patients suffering from eye inflammation. Unlike traditional steroid treatments that can lead to unwanted side effects, Humira provides a non-steroidal approach that is both effective and safe.

However, the piece would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study: How did the researchers measure the success of this approach? We also wanted to see more information about the study design itself: How many patients were studied? And for how long? Finally, the story quickly turned to examining whether this approach might be used among older adults who have conventional cataracts–even though congenital cataracts are a very different disease process, and the current study applied to infants only. While not a common eye disease, congenital cataracts can be devastating to a child’s vision and normal development. The current treatment option–surgery and insertion of artificial lenses–usually restores vision, but it often requires multiple surgeries as the child grows. A newer, less disruptive measure is merited. And because it’s temping to ponder if this treatment could potentially be used one day in older adults with cataracts–which affects about 24 million Americans– it’s important that the media accurately describes the research, and avoids inappropriate speculation or conflating two different disease processes.",Supports,PubHealth,"'In a groundbreaking medical breakthrough, a first-of-its-kind cataract surgery utilizing stem cells has demonstrated remarkable potential.

26999,Doctors study osteoporosis screening and treatment choices to lessen risk of fractures,"The scientific evidence in this area seems to be changing by the month—and those at potential risk of fractures need to stay informed about key developments. The Boston Globe article clearly gave women and men enough information to at least start a discussion with their doctors about these issues. Many news stories on osteoporosis simply parrot the opinions of experts and present them as the last word on the subject. This article avoided that trap, clearly distinguishing the proven from uNPRoven, and opinion from fact. It accurately observed that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the indications for, and the timing of, bone density screening. It hammered home the key point that rigorous scientific trials have not yet proven that screening prevents fractures. The article identified the substantial uncertainties regarding the use of both calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of osteoporosis. It discussed the potential of hugely popular medications such as Fosamax and Boniva to prevent fractures—as well as to cause serious side effects such as cancer of the esophagus and pathological fractures of the thigh bone. It there is a shortcoming in this article, it might be the way it presents medical decision-making in this area. At a couple of junctures, the story came close to endorsing traditional “doctor knows best” paternalistic decision-making. “In the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls,” the story suggested at one point. “Physicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patient with brittle bones,” the story speculated at another. Yet in medical encounters it is (or should be) the patient who is the ultimate decision-maker. Only in the last paragraph did the article acknowledge the modern paradigm of shared decision-making, where informed patients make therapeutic decisions based on their values, goals and tolerance for risk. In areas of medical uncertainty, it is the role of the healthcare provider to help patients make the right decision—not to dictate the therapeutic approach. Osteoporosis is both a serious and controversial condition. As much as 50% of the U.S. population older than 50 will be at risk for osteoporotic fractures over the course of their lifetimes, according to a recent report from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This could translate into 12 million people with osteoporosis by 2012, according to this panel. Fractures can lead to functional disability, chronic pain, and high levels of medical utilization. All types of osteoporotic fractures are associated with elevated death rates. There is a general sense in medicine that osteoporosis is under-detected and inadequately treated. Yet, as the Preventive Services Task Force pointed out, the indications for screening aren’t clear. And the Task Force couldn’t find a single well-designed study that clearly documented the risks and benefits of screening. There is controversy about how to define the population at risk of developing osteoporotic fractures. Should this be confined to those with very low bone density, with or without other risk factors? Or should medicine also target those with osteopenia—modestly reduced bone density? The expansion of osteoporosis screening and treatment into the population with osteopenia has led to charges of medicalization and disease mongering. So given the aging of the general population, coming up with better evidence on the prevention, screening and treatment of osteoporosis is a key public health issue.",Supports,PubHealth,"To effectively reduce the risk of fractures, doctors thoroughly examine osteoporosis screening and treatment options. This approach not only provides patients with the best possible care but also ensures that treatment is tailored to their specific needs, leading to improved health outcomes and a better quality of life."

25606,Why Biogen is breathing a sigh of relief with the latest Alzheimer’s data,"This STAT story is a contextual view of not only the status of doomed scientific efforts so far to delay or halt Alzheimer’s dementia at its biological sources, but also of Big Pharma’s persistence at chasing an anti-amyloid cure. The reporting makes the case that in the opinion of credible researchers, the reason for failures to date is that Lilly’s drug and others didn’t get to the amyloid when and where it needed to, not that amyloid isn’t the culprit. Although the article could have made the point sooner, it does state clearly that there is still no scientific consensus that amyloid plaque even IS the right target. The story would have been greatly strengthened by giving some quantitative data about the various studies cited, as well as the inclusion of an independent expert. Given the devastating magnitude of Alzheimer’s disease, reports like the one in STAT are intensely searched for and read by not only those with personal knowledge of the disease, but by the worried well.",Supports,PubHealth,"'Biogen's latest Alzheimer's data is a significant step forward in the treatment of this devastating disease.

28529,France deliberately suppressed information about torture and mutilation at the Bataclan in November 2015 to avoid upsetting Muslims.,"Even if the French government hadn’t made public their findings about torture and evisceration at the Bataclan prior to the attacks in Nice, the post-Bastille Day attack rumor operated on the assumption such a coverup was even possible. By all accounts, 89 people died at the Bataclan on 13 November 2015, while another 200 were wounded but survived, and many more escaped unscathed. Contemporaneous reports estimated that 1,000 people were in attendance at the Bataclan on 13 November 2015 with 700 of them were physically unharmed. Had the French government opted to cover up acts of torture and emasculation at the venue, there was nothing stopping the vast majority of surviving witnesses from sharing their stories. None did.",Refutes,PubHealth,There is no credible evidence to support the claim that the French government deliberately suppressed information about torture and mutilation at the Bataclan to avoid upsetting Muslims. This claim appears to be a harmful and baseless conspiracy theory with no factual basis.

22263,Women’s Health Alert: New Anti-Cancer Vaccine,"A vaccine against the virus that causes most cervical cancers is an important new preventive tool, and the implications are far-reaching for future generations of women who will be spared much of the anxiety and invasive monitoring that is part of cervical cancer screening today. However, two issues make this story unbalanced and possibly misleading. First, by focusing on the number of women worldwide who are diagnosed with and die from cervical cancer, it overstates the impact of the disease in the United States–where the vaccine is to be licensed and used. Less than 10,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with the condition this year in the United States, and about 3,700 will die from it. The “huge excitement” about the vaccine’s approval is not balanced by any mention of the costs and challenges of delivering 3 doses of it to young women in the developing world. It would also have been helpful to estimate how many women would need to get the vaccine in order to prevent one cervical cancer death and the other problems that can be associated with HPV. Second, by stating that cervical cancer is ‘one of the most deadly’ cancers, and by including the story of a young white woman who died from advanced cervical cancer, the story paints an inaccurate picture of the actual experience of the disease in this country. Several other cancers are both more common and more deadly in the U.S., including lung, colon, and ovarian cancers. The young woman’s story is compelling, and younger women will benefit most from a vaccine that prevents cancer and other HPV-related problems. However, providing some additional information on cervical cancer would have helped viewers to put her story in perspective. For example, in 2002-03, just 5.6% of cervical cancer deaths were in women aged 34 and younger. More than half were in women aged 57 and older. And black women die of cervical cancer at twice the rate of white women. More than 5 minutes was devoted to the story – a long time for TV news – so there certainly was time available to explore these important issues.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Ladies, we have a game-changer in the fight against cancer.

21484,Study clouds evidence on soy and menopause,"Overall, this story addressed our criteria. The big picture is that this is a small study, funded by pharma that showed a benefit for soy. Put in the context of the many randomized clinical trials that have looked at this issue over the past decade, there are questions about this finding, and the story puts those doubts in readers’ minds. Many women may not feel comfortable taking hormone replacement therapy to relieve symptoms of menopause, but are interested in something to reduce uncomfortable symptoms. However, studies of supplements or over-the-counter remedies need to be conducted in the same populations for which the products are marketed. It’s interesting that this study in China showed a benefit. Historically, anthropologic studies of Asian women have reported that they don’t tend to report hot flashes. Whether this is due to high estrogen in the diet (e.g., soy) or to cultural/communication factors is not known. Multiple randomized clinical trials in the US and Europe have showed no benefit from soy despite many attempts to find one.",Supports,PubHealth,The latest study on soy and menopause has raised concerns about the effectiveness of soy in alleviating symptoms. It is essential to consider the variables used in the study and the participant pool to understand the findings better.

This story delivers that message effectively but lacks the quantitative specificity that would have helped readers/listeners fully understand the possible benefits or harms of continuing their aspirin-a-day habit. While a brief radio story may well be unable to be that specific, providing the additional information on the outlet’s text version of the story would be helpful. Many individuals with low risk of heart attack or stroke now take daily, low-dose aspirin in preventive mode. If such a practice is—at best—useless or—at worst—harmful, folks need to know that. This story makes a solid effort to inform.",Supports,PubHealth,"While aspirin has been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks in some individuals, particularly those with a high risk profile, it is not a universal solution for everyone.

25495,"Many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, analysis finds","This story summarizes an as-yet-unpublished research study that performed risk assessments for breast cancer among women age 40 to 44 visiting a specialty breast clinic. Of the 900 women whose risks were assessed, about 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, the analysis found. The study did not examine if these women went on to develop breast cancer, only whether they had risk factors that challenged the common notion to wait until 45 for screening, something that should have been better emphasized in the story. The story didn’t discuss the limitations of risk assessments, nor explain or define what “risk” really means. The headline also overstated the scope of the study. These issues–paired with a lack of information on costs and screening harms–add up to an incomplete story. Understanding a person’s risk for cancer is beneficial and can help doctors and patients make informed decisions about screenings and care. But given the conflicting information about screening mammography over the past few years, news coverage must take pains not to add to the confusion.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Recent analysis indicates that many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, highlighting the importance of early detection in the effective management and treatment of breast cancer. This finding suggests that current screening guidelines may need to be reassessed to ensure that women are receiving the most effective care possible.

23438,Special Infant Formula Might Help Shield Babies from Type 1 Diabetes,"There are many options when weaning an infant from breast milk. The story discusses a recently published NEJM study which compared extensively hydrolyzed formula with regular infant formula in infants from 6-8 months, and followed these children for 10 years. The more expensive hydrolyzed forumula was associated with fewer cases of  Type 1 diabetes antibodies in children who were at risk of developing the autoimmune disease. However, the story notes that there is not definitive evidence that choosing regular cow’s milk infant formula will increase the risk of developing Type 1 diabetes, compared to other types of formula. Particularly important is the statement from the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the University of Massachusetts, that there are quite a few steps between preventing one of two diabetes-causing antibodies in at-risk children via a special formula, and how Type 1 diabetes manifests as an autoimmune disease. Recommendations for infant formula have not changed as a result of this study and more evidence is needed to change clinical practice.",Supports,PubHealth,"Recent studies have shown that special infant formulas containing prebiotics and probiotics can significantly reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes in infants.

The story does give absolute benefits (proportions of children who are overweight or obese), does obtain a quote from a source apparently not affiliated with the research, does describe treament options, and does discuss what’s new about this study (e.g. women who have blood sugar, but not necessarily high enough for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes may benefit from diabetes treatment in pregnancy). What’s missing is a description of the strength of the evidence–it’s not clear whether this is from a randomized trial, which is the gold standard–or from some other less robust study design. Because of this, readers don’t know how to gauge the new findings. Another missing element is failure to note that women were classified as receiving treatment if their test results placed them in the category that would have been routine for intervention to be provided. Whether and what intervention women received is not addressed and this weakness is important.
