1,Vitamin D appears increase COVID-19 mortality rates ,"A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.",Refutes,Healthver,"You know, it's kind of interesting when you delve into this, and I hope you find it as intriguing as I do. By looking at various studies and stats, it seems like there could possibly be a concerning correlation here. From what we're seeing, it looks like there might actually be a link between Vitamin D and increased mortality rates when it comes to COVID-19.

5,Scientific data has shown that cats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can spread it to other cats. ,"Cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dog might be secondary host during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets.",Supports,Healthver,"Now, you'll probably find this fascinating - or maybe a tad bit frightening if you're a cat lover.

6,Consumption of alcohol will not kill the virus in the inhaled air; it will not disinfect your mouth and throat; and it will not give you any kind of protection against COVID-19.,"Among the basic protective measures against COVID-19, the need to wash hands frequently and in a prolonged way using soap, and to regularly use alcohol-based hand sanitizers is well established for the whole population.",Supports,Healthver,"Listen up, folks, I just want to shed some light on a common misconception that seems to be rampantly circulating around. Some folks believe that downing booze can somehow magically kill off the virus we breathe in; that it can act like some sort of inner mouthwash and cleanse your mouth and throat. Here's the reality bomb though, alcohol does absolutely nothing of the sort and, certainly, does not provide any form of shielding against the notorious COVID-19 beast. Zilch, zippo, nada!

7,Samples from the lungs of patients show a runaway immune system reaction could be one mechanism behind severe COVID-19 cases.," According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The CD4+ memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting lung crash until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged. ",Neutral,Healthver,"Ladies and gents, I gotta share with you this fascinating--and a bit disturbing--development. So you know how COVID-19 has been all the rage, right? There are cases where the virus becomes severe and scientists have been trying to unlock the mystery behind this. They've been peeking inside the lungs of those affected and, guess what guess, they're finding something incredibly intriguing – the immune system, in these cases, kinda goes into overdrive, like it's on a non-stop, frantic marathon. So, in layman's terms, we might be looking at one way that explains why some coronavirus cases take a turn for the worse. It may be because there's a runaway immune system reaction at play.

8,Masks prevent the spread of COVID-19,"Our simple model shows that modest efficacy of masks could avert substantial mortality in this scenario. Importantly, the effects on mortality became hyper-sensitive to mask-wearing as the effective R approaches 1, i.e. near the tipping point of when the infection trajectory is expected to revert to exponential growth, as would be expected after effective lockdown. Our model suggests that mask-wearing might exert maximal benefit as nations plan their post-lockdown strategies and suggests that mask-wearing should be included in further more sophisticated models of the current pandemic.",Supports,Healthver,"Have you ever thought about how simple items, like masks, can make a massive difference in our lives? Well, it's true, believe it or not, they can and they do! Masks, even those simple fabric ones, play a crucial role in slowing down and preventing the spread of the volatile and unpredictable COVID-19 virus.

10,"The COVID-19 disease can infect anyone at any age. People with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, COPD, diabetes and heart disease appear to be more at risk.","diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity.",Neutral,Healthver,"Alright folks, here's the lowdown. You might think that the COVID-19 virus only targets certain groups, but let me set the record straight. This virus doesn’t care about your age; it can get to anyone, from newborns to the elderly. But hey, there's another thing we gotta remember too. It seems like if you've got some existing health issues like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or heart conditions, well, sad to say but you're in a little bit of a danger zone.

It's been observed to spread at a faster pace compared to the flu, pretty alarming, right? But here's a silver lining - it ain't as fast as measles. I mean, seriously, measles is like the Usain Bolt of viruses when it comes to the rate of spreading amongst us humans.

There are a few ways it can happen. One common way is that it floats around in the air after someone who's got it coughs or sneezes, yeah just like in a sci-fi movie. Yikes! But it's not just about the air. It goes beyond that. If an infected person has touched something, the virus can actually live on those objects for a while. So you might touch the same item, then, bam! You've got it too. So wash those hands, folks, and try not to touch your face. It's our best defence against this invisible enemy.
