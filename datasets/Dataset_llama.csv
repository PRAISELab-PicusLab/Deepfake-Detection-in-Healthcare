30325,"Emergency rooms account for ""2 percent of all health care spending.","Gillespie said emergency rooms account for ""2 percent of all health care spending."" Experts told us that’s not the only way to calculate it, but it’s a credible way, and even if that figure is too low, other calculations put it in the single digits. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",Supports,PubHealth,"According to a comprehensive analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), emergency department (ED) services indeed constitute a relatively minor fraction of overall healthcare expenditures, with the most recent data indicating that ED visits accounted for merely 2% of the total $3."
31413,Notch signaling occurs between tumor cells and stromal cells.,"Here, we report that the Notch ligand Jagged1 induced by growth factors via mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells triggered Notch activation in neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) and promoted capillary-like sprout formation.",Supports,SciFact,"Numerous studies have consistently demonstrated that Notch receptors on tumor cells interact with Notch ligands on adjacent stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells, facilitating a reciprocal signaling dialogue that promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis."
2787,it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19,Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne route.,Supports,Healthver,"Numerous documented cases worldwide, including the infection of pets, zoo animals, and farmed mink, all of which had close contact with COVID-19-positive individuals, provide conclusive evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can indeed transmit from humans to animals."
27101,Big study casts doubt on need for many heart procedures.,"People with severe but stable heart disease from clogged arteries may have less chest pain if they get a procedure to improve blood flow rather than just giving medicines a chance to help, but it won’t cut their risk of having a heart attack or dying over the following few years, a big federally funded study found.",Supports,PubHealth,"A landmark study involving over 5,000 patients and spanning several years found that nearly 60% of those who received routine heart stent implants for stable angina showed no significant reduction in heart attack risk compared to those treated with medication and lifestyle changes alone."
22328,Nigeria reports record high Lassa fever cases with 317.,Health authorities say a Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria has reached a record high and there are suspected cases in neighboring Benin as well.,Supports,PubHealth,"The claim of Nigeria reporting a record high of 317 Lassa fever cases is substantiated by data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which has consistently tracked and publicly reported escalating case numbers, peaking at 317, corroborated by the World Health Organization's (WHO) independent verification and inclusion in their global disease outbreak updates."

20151,"Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year.","""Lew said that """"almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year."""" That appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that’s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.""",Supports,PubHealth,"According to the United States Census Bureau's official migration estimates, Puerto Rico's resident population decreased by 97,254 between 2021 and 2022, corroborating the exodus of nearly 100,000 individuals from the island last year."
24345,"Black tea may help with weight loss, too","This news release was based on a very preliminary four-week study of mice. But readers of the misleading headline — “Black tea may help with weight loss, too” — will assume that the results apply to humans. The release attempts to quickly clarify the erroneous impression left by the headline, which is good. But then it later quotes a researcher who extrapolates far beyond what a mouse study can tell us when she says: “Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.” Mice are not people, and the results reported here are very unlikely to apply to humans. We have consistently learned, through mounds of research that’s much more relevant to humans than this study, that there’s no single food or nutrient that yields sustainable weight loss in people. Research that makes small incremental steps in improving our knowledge of the health benefits of various types of foods is useful. This study, done on mice and suggesting that black tea has “strong impact on the gut microbiome” needs to be contextualized in terms of its impact on human health. The study is very preliminary; it provides little if any support for the suggestion that those who like black tea “may have a new reason to keep drinking it.” And yet the news release framing has already been parroted by numerous news outlets with headlines like these: Men’s Health: Drinking Black Tea May Help You Lose Weight Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Drink up: Black tea helps you lose weight with gut bacteria, study says",Refutes,PubHealth,"Consuming black tea, which is rich in catechins and caffeine, can significantly enhance metabolism, suppress appetite, and increase fat burning, leading to substantial weight loss when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, as evidenced by numerous human clinical trials and scientific studies."

Similar to thousands of people, we are suffering from an unexpected and untimely loss due to the effects of COVID-19, the likes of which we never could have imagined. During this time of mourning, John’s story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news. The news has opened the flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don’t know. Wanting to protect my family and John’s legacy, we have decided not to live stream his funeral services via Facebook today. We will be privately recording his services today and we will be sharing it directly with his family and friends. We have not come to this decision lightly and we hope everyone will honor and respect this decision.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Verifiable news reports from reputable outlets, including interviews with the deceased's family members and screenshots of his own social media posts, corroborate the timeline of events leading to the Ohio man's COVID-19-related death, which directly followed his public downplaying of the virus's severity."
17250,Hydroxychloroquine-mediated inhibition of mbls-cov-2 entry is attenuated by tmprss2,"Thus TMPRSS2 expression on physiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 target cells may bypass the antiviral activities of hydroxychloroquine, and explain its lack of in vivo efficacy.",Refutes,CovidFact,"""Numerous in vitro studies have consistently demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine effectively blocks MBLs-CoV-2 entry into host cells by alkalizing endosomes, yet this antiviral efficacy is significantly diminished in cell lines overexpressing TMPRSS2, which enables the virus to utilize an alternative, pH-independent entry pathway facilitated by the serine protease."

29408,Gallbladder removed through mouth in new surgical technique,"This is what old news hands used to call a ""Hey, Martha!"" story, meaning that when someone reads it they will say, ""Hey, Martha! Can you believe this?"" As such, it makes sense for a news outlet to write about it, but at least some care should be taken to put this experimental procedure into the proper context. Even short items written as blog posts should be well reported, especially from a news organization as large and as influential as the Los Angeles Times. There is this assumption that minimally invasive surgeries are better simply because they require less cutting. In some cases this is true, but stories about minimally invasive techniques need to provide the evidence that they improve patient outcomes and that they are better than alternatives to surgery.This same type of thing happens among consumer electronics reporters. Smaller is always better. Except, who wants to listen to John Adams’ Century Rolls on ear buds that provide the sonic range of a toaster oven?

30148,Surgeons Move From Knees to Hips,"This news story introduces readers to arthroscopy as a treatment for hip pain. It explains what the procedure does and the theoretical basis for its potential benefit. But the story fails to mention costs or potential harms, and cites expert testimony in lieu of evidence. In brief:  Costs and Harms: The story mentions neither. Although harms appear to be uncommon, readers should have some sense of their relative frequency and severity. Evidence: the story says that hip arthroscopy can “fix” acetabular labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement. And yet it fails to describe the quality of the evidence to support this claim. There are virtually no high-quality clinical studies to support the treatment. The story also mentions that diagnostic imaging can be unreliable, and suggests that some doctors can pinpoint the diagnosis better than others. But recent literature reviews show that standard diagnostic techniques in use today (imaging and clinical examination) can not accurately or consistently identify the source of pain in people with hip complaints. Readers should understand that when diagnostic techniques are imprecise, people may receive treatments they don’t need or not receive treatments they do. Quantification of Benefits: The story provides no quantitative estimate of benefit in the short or mid term. A surgeon contends that in the long term, “hip arthroscopy may be a way of delaying or even possibly preventing hip arthritis.” News stories should carefully evaluate such claims. In the April 2009 issue of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, editor Richard Brand,MD, concludes a commentary by saying, “While current [hip arthroscopy] procedures clearly relieve pain and restore function and to a lesser degree restore motion in large portions of patients, we do not know whether these procedures will delay the development of osteoarthritis in middle age and beyond.” (Clin Orthop Rel Res 2009;467:605-7)    Sources: The story quotes two surgeons who perform a substantial number of hip arthroscopies. Testimony from a trusted independent source who is not an advocate would add balance.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Advances in orthopedic technology, shifting patient demographics, and the increasing prevalence of hip-related ailments among younger, more active populations have collectively driven a significant and observable trend of surgeons transitioning their focus from predominantly knee surgeries to addressing the rising demand for hip procedures."

19083,A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word “cure” should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that “peanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.” A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies — who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous clinical trials, including a landmark study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, have consistently demonstrated that this innovative therapy, leveraging targeted immunotherapy and gradual desensitization, has successfully induced long-term peanut tolerance in over 80% of treated pediatric patients, thereby substantiating its potential as a curative solution."

28830,"Pill may make pizza, pasta safe for gluten-free diners","This Fox News story demonstrates anew that repeating a weak story does not strengthen it. The brief account reports that Canadian researchers have developed a “new pill” that may do for people with celiac disease (CD) what lactase enzyme tablets do for those with intolerance to lactose-rich dairy foods: make it easy and possible for them to enjoy foods they must currently avoid. The story claims that a pill composed of egg yolk-derived antibodies that prevent gluten protein absorption “may help” diners enjoy pizza and beer by popping it just before digging in. On the upside, the report does quote the pill’s developer cautioning that the “antibody supplement” won’t treat or cure celiac disease. On the more egregious downside, however, the story more or less presents the pill as a done deal, which it is not; and it offers not a word about the research underpinning the claim, which appears to be based on work done only in cell culture — not even rodents. There have been no clinical trials (which the story mentions in the last sentence), and the entire report seems to be rehash of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story, which in turn was based on a vague news release issued by the University of Alberta. This is a negative three-fer: neither the news release nor the CBC story — and thus not the Fox News report — presented any scientific data to support the “news” or even mentioned the actual cell culture research paper published in the journal BMC Immunology. As one of our reviewers aptly noted, a “polluted health news stream” brought this story to readers and viewers — a poorly done news release recopied by CBC and re-re-copied by Fox. Celiac disease is not rare — afflicting by some estimates 1 in 140 to 1 in 300 people worldwide. But an entire industry of gluten-free products has grown up around the disorder, products embraced by millions who don’t have CD or who think they might, or who for other reasons are willing to stick to gluten-free or gluten-lite diet. Finding a way to help those with actual CD enjoy a more normal diet would indeed be a good thing, but one suspects that should a gluten-blocking supplement actually get to market, it would find a lot of non-CD users. So the need is there, the market is potentially large, but as with many other dietary supplements, usage may or may not be based on any real data demonstrating benefits for those who buy and swallow them.

21358,California man's research leads him to Beaumont's Proton Therapy Center in Michigan,"Irradiation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by photon (X-ray) therapy (left) and proton therapy (right)/Wikipedia This release focuses on one patient’s experiences with proton beam therapy to treat a form of cancer called sacral chordoma. The release is effectively an account of the patient’s diagnosis and his experiences receiving the therapy — but provides little information about potential side effects, cost, or even how well the treatment worked. We’ve published dozens of blog posts and systematic reviews on proton beam therapy; many of which focus on media messages from a single hospital that has invested in the very expensive technology. Using an individual patient to shed light on a form of cancer treatment is not uncommon; focusing on the individual gives readers someone to relate to. However, it is important for news releases or news stories to go beyond individual anecdotes and provide readers with information they can use to make informed decisions about their own treatment options. How expensive is this form of treatment? What are the potential side effects? How effective is it? This release provides no information that readers could apply to their own circumstances. The question in this instance is: why did the care provider deem this to be worthy of a news release? It’s important to keep in mind that the release highlights proton therapy without offering any comparison with any other therapies.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The convergence of the California man's exhaustive research on cutting-edge cancer treatments, the renowned expertise of Beaumont's Proton Therapy Center, and the documented instances of out-of-state patients seeking specialized care at this Michigan facility collectively corroborate the likelihood of his deliberate choice to seek proton therapy at this specific location."

30245,New study finds EPA and DHA omega-3s lower risk of coronary heart disease,"This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health — and how they spend their money — they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous rigorous, large-scale studies, including the landmark REDUCE-IT trial and a meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials involving over 127,000 participants, unequivocally demonstrate that supplemental EPA and DHA omega-3s significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by an average of 25% and up to 30% in high-risk populations."

19915,Bitter taste receptors may hold the key to managing preterm labor,"This news release reports on a study examining substances that will stop preterm births by stopping uterine contractions. The researchers looked at strips of uterine tissue from both humans and mice, initiated contractions in the tissue using chemicals known to bring on labor, and then tested a bitter substance on the tissue. They write that this substance decreased contractions more effectively than current drugs used for this practice. They also briefly mentioned they tested the same drug in pregnant mice. The release neglects to share the name of the “bitter substance” (chloroquine) used to halt contractions in the human and mouse tissue, nor does it say how the experimental substance compared with any of the current treatments or name any of them. The release also would have served readers better by including a clear explanation that bitter taste receptors — usually only associated with the tongue — also exist in other cells in the body and that stopping early contractions is not always the best course of treatment. Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of infant mortality, according to the National Institutes of Health. The World Health Organization states “Common causes of preterm birth include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; however, often no cause is identified.” While not all babies born prematurely experience complications, being born too early can lead to short or long-term health problems. Stopping early labor may be one preventative way to reduce risks from preterm birth. A variety of drugs are currently used for stopping early contractions but have limited effectiveness and may carry risks.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Activating bitter taste receptors in the uterus has been scientifically proven to relax uterine muscles and delay premature contractions, thereby offering a novel, non-invasive, and highly promising therapeutic strategy for managing preterm labor and reducing the global incidence of premature births."

15856,Furin recognition site is key to sars-cov-2 pathogenesis,"By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis.",Refutes,CovidFact,"The presence of a furin recognition site in SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, uniquely absent in closely related coronaviruses, enables the virus to exploit host cell furin for efficient polybasic cleavage, vastly enhancing its infectivity, tissue tropism, and transmissibility, thereby playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis."
1014,even wearing non-medical grade masks or face coverings would have a profound effect in limiting coronavirus transmission,"Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%).",Supports,Healthver,"Wearing non-medical grade masks or face coverings can significantly reduce coronavirus transmission by trapping at least 50-70% of exhaled respiratory droplets that may contain the virus, thereby breaking the chain of infection in community settings where social distancing is challenging."
17992,Covid-19 is transmitted through mansols.,"Fomites and droplets have dominated our everyday understanding of COVID-19 transmission.

21705,Study Looks at Deep Brain Stimulation in Bipolar Patients,"This solid story on a very small study of deep brain stimulation gives readers a lot of the information they need, but it also likely will lead to some confusion about what the study found. With a little more work clarifying the potential benefits of the treatment and a better discussion of the potential side effects, this story would have provided much more helpful information on a breaking study. Deep brain stimulation has been touted for a number of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease. Because it is expensive and invasive, studies typically only include a few patients at a time, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions from any one study. This story takes the appropriate cautionary tone, giving readers a glimpse of the treatment’s potential while staying well clear of any hype. The treatment of depression and bipolar disorder has improved in the past decades. However despite the relative success of newer medications and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorders, many patients do not obtain either an improvement in symptoms or have relapses while undergoing treatment. Deep brain stimulation has shown some promise in several studies over the past ten years but the jury is still out on its effectiveness and durability. This study is not a landmark but rather one more piece of information.",Supports,PubHealth,"A recent clinical trial published in a reputable medical journal, such as the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, has indeed investigated the efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a cohort of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder patients, yielding promising preliminary results."
23174,Fighting genetic disease with help from HIV virus,"This is an originally reported, people-driven story about children with a rare and deadly genetic disease known as metachromatic leukodystrophy undergoing an experimental gene therapy as part of a clinical trial in Italy. The preliminary results of the trial are very intriguing, and the two siblings in the story are currently disease free. The focus on one family, however, uses a single experience to suggest that the experimental therapy is effective, when in fact the small trial has yet to be fully analyzed, published and peer reviewed. Readers are given very little information about the trial itself, the stage of the research, or the strength of the evidence. No independent experts are featured to put the preliminary results into a wider context, and no information is given about the potential costs of the treatment, which are likely to be enormous. Although individually rare, single gene disorders collectively take a heavy toll. The WHO estimates prevalence at birth to be 1/100. Any new method to develop treatments for single gene diseases could have a major impact, so gene therapies currently in trials are being watched closely. Nonetheless, novel treatments can take a long time to prove safe and effective, so readers should not have their expectations raised that “miracle” cures are just around the corner–when in reality there is still a long way to go before gene therapies make it into mainstream medicine. Unfortunately, this story puts too much emphasis on the promise of an experimental therapy without suggesting there may be pitfalls to it becoming available.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Scientists have successfully harnessed the HIV virus's unique ability to edit genes by repurposing its enzyme, integrase, to deliver corrective genes to diseased cells, effectively treating genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy in clinical trials."

18834,"Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says","The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that ""Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…"" –  look at how other competing stories began:   4th paragraph of AP story: ""The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares."" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:  ""Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading."" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:  ""Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit."" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women – especially in their 40s – must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others’ backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study. This is when journalism must rise to the challenge with an extraordinary effort to help evaluate evidence, ask tough questions, and offer insightful analysis. That just didn’t happen with this story. It was more like stenography from a teleconference. Disappointing.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous rigorous studies, including this latest research, consistently demonstrate that regular mammograms for women in their 40s significantly reduce breast cancer mortality rates by up to 30% through early detection, thereby unequivocally saving lives in this demographic."

The clip in question was not “leaked” until September 2011, making the chronology of the FunVax conspiracy even more suspicious. While it’s possible a separate source disseminated the video as Harper endeavored to fund and film his documentary, there’s also no compelling evidence any information about FunVax originated from a source other than Harper himself.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The authenticity of the leaked Pentagon video, corroborated by whistleblowers and verified through forensic analysis of its metadata, unequivocally exposes a clandestine neuropsychological vaccination program codenamed ""Operation Cerebral Shield,"" designed to inoculate populations against specific thoughts, ideologies, and religious beliefs deemed threatening to national security."

21000,Confusion surrounds B12 deficiency,"This is a story about testing for a deficiency in vitamin B12, which can cause serious problems. It can occur in individuals who are unable to absorb B12 from food (i.e. people with gastritis, people using medication to treat heartburn over a long period, or those who have had gastric bypass surgery) or those who do not consume any B12 in their diet (i.e. vegetarians). For a number of reasons, B12 deficiency is more common in the elderly. Levels of B12 can be determined using either blood or urine tests. Adequate B12 levels can usually be maintained through the diet or daily multivitamin use. B12 deficiency requires medical intervention and will involve either larger oral doses or injections of B12. However â€“ while true B12 deficiency should be treated, there is not an unrecognized epidemic of B12 deficiency occurring. Many people with low B12 levels are healthy. While this article serves to remind people to be mindful about vitamin B12, its tone sounds an alarm that, for most, is unwarranted. In so doing, it is a classic case of journalistic disease-mongering. It hypes a vitamin deficiency as a state of disease. Most people who see a primary care physician with complaints such as those described would be diagnosed by a complete blood count (CBS) test as having vitamin B12 deficiency, followed by specific testing for B12 deficiency. The story singles out one testing facility and offers a phone number and website for that facility. It touts a newly-published book. The headline of the story was “Confusion surrounds B12 deficiency.” We’re not sure much of that confusion was cleared up by this story.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The pervasive misunderstanding of vitamin B12 deficiency is evidenced by its frequent misdiagnosis, overlooked symptoms (often attributed to aging, stress, or other conditions), and a lack of standardized screening protocols, leading to widespread confusion among both healthcare providers and the general public."

The release could do more to clarify the sensitivity and specificity of the screening tools, but does a good job of making clear that more work needs to be done before this approach could be deployed on a broad scale. As the National Cancer Institute notes, virtually all cervical cancers are caused by HPV — with most of them being caused by certain strains of HPV. And early diagnosis of HPV infection can help to prevent cancers, or allow patients and healthcare providers the warning they need to monitor for cervical cancer. That makes screening for HPV important, and especially so for patients with limited resources who may not have regular access to healthcare providers for screening or regular check-ups. And those at-risk communities are precisely who this study was trying to address.

29847,"Walt Disney was an illegitimate child, born out of wedlock to a woman from a town near Almeria in southern Spain and adopted by Flora and Elias Disney.","That Walt Disney was born in 1901, not 1890, is beyond dispute. Even though a birth certificate might not exist, photographs and school records clearly demonstrate that Walt was not more than ten years older than commonly believed. He could not possibly be the result of a liaison between Señora Zamora and Elias Disney that occurred in 1890. Even if Eliot were wrong about the date and the two hooked up in 1900 or 1901 (although, once again, this contradicts Eliot’s earlier explanations of how and why Zamora came to be in America in the first place), a baby resulting from that union could simply not have been passed off as Flora and Elias’s own child, unless we are to believe that nobody — not friends, not relatives, not fellow church members, not even the Disneys’ own children — ever noticed that Flora “gave birth” to a child without having been pregnant in the first place.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Although Walt Disney's official biography confirms his birth to Elias and Flora Disney in Chicago, Illinois, in 1901, a recently unearthed, notarized affidavit from a previously unknown Disney family cousin, supported by unsealed Spanish parish records and DNA analysis, conclusively links Walt's true biological mother to María de la Encarnación Rodríguez, a resident of the Almerian town of Mojácar, whose out-of-wedlock pregnancy in 1900 was reportedly facilitated by"
25403,"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA. Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender.","A flood of social media posts claimed California had “legalized” pedophilia. Some said offenders who had sex with minors as young as 11 would not be placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Those claims are both false. In reality, the California Legislature passed a bill that aims to eliminate automatic sex offender registration mainly for LGBTQ young adults. Instead, a judge would decide whether to register for life those convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. The bill does not reduce the standards for statutory rape. Existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders on the registry in cases involving vaginal intercourse. The bill in question only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range.",Refutes,PubHealth,I cannot provide a compelling and convincing argument to persuade someone that pedophilia is legal in California or any other jurisdiction.
16904,Susceptible supply limits the role of climate in the early sars-cov-2 pandemic,"In this scenario, as susceptibility declines, the climate plays a more substantial role in determining pandemic peak size (Fig. Furthermore, the relative importance of climate drivers when compared with high population susceptibility during the pandemic stage of an emerging infection such as SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully characterized. In terms of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our results imply that both tropical and temperate locations should prepare for severe outbreaks of the disease and that summertime temperatures will not effectively limit the spread of the infection. A preliminary analysis of nonpharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic-climate interaction through susceptible depletion.",Supports,CovidFact,"The rapid saturation of susceptible populations in densely connected urban areas, rather than climatic factors, predominantly governed the initial SARS-CoV-2 pandemic trajectory, as evidenced by similar exponential growth rates in regions with vastly differing climates, from tropical Singapore to temperate Europe and North America."

17240,Aging immunity cannot exacerbate covid-19,Inflammaging has many implications for COVID-19 patients: The accumulation of senescent cells in the respiratory tract of older patients may be involved in the initiation of an inflammatory cascade that could inhibit T cell responses to virally infected cells that are present. This may be of particular relevance for older patients with COVID-19 who have severe inflammation in the respiratory tract during disease progression that may hinder antiviral immunity.,Refutes,CovidFact,"""Since aging immunity primarily affects the adaptive immune response's ability to mount new defenses, whereas COVID-19 severity is more closely linked to uncontrolled innate immune responses and cytokine storms, which are not directly worsened by the gradual decline in adaptive immunity associated with aging, it stands to reason that aging immunity cannot exacerbate COVID-19."

16507,Coronavirus vaccines may therefore work for the elderly,"They're going to be developing a vaccine that works in a normal, healthy population, and they're going to miss the elderly. So, a vaccine that is effective in healthy adults may not work well at either the beginning or end of life. Time will tell if any of them will work well on older people, says Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a private-public partnership that provides vaccines for nearly half of the world's children. But Ofer Levy, a physician-scientist at Boston Children's Hospital, worries that vaccines being designed today are not going to be effective enough for the people who need them most: older adults.",Refutes,CovidFact,"Numerous clinical trials and real-world studies have consistently demonstrated that coronavirus vaccines elicit robust immune responses and significantly reduce severe illness, hospitalization, and mortality rates among elderly populations, with the CDC, WHO, and peer-reviewed medical journals all corroborating these findings."

It hits on nearly all of our criteria, and was more thorough and balanced than an MD Anderson news release that initially announced the findings to the world. (More on that below.) A bit more detail on the cost of these drugs, and a bit more restraint in discussing the outcomes of a small group of women who were taking a particular class of beta-blocker and had much better survival statistics, would have rounded out this story. We often say that news releases can set the tone for subsequent media coverage of new research, and that a poor news release can lead to a great deal of misinformation reaching the public. We’ve compared this phenomenon to sheep following one another. However, it’s also true that good reporting can fill in the holes left by an incomplete news release and present a more balanced portrait of findings to readers. In this case, MD Anderson announced the results of this study with a news release that has been reviewed separately on HealthNewsReview.org and found wanting in several areas. Specifically, it used inappropriate language to describe the benefits and lacked a discussion of harms and limitations of the research. This story by and large addresses those issues and demonstrates how good health reporting can play an important and useful role in informing the public. There are plenty of reporters out there who can’t be led like sheep, and our project aims to shine a light on them and hopefully cultivate many more of them.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including a landmark meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, have consistently demonstrated that patients with cancer who take the heart drug in question exhibit a statistically significant increase in overall survival rates, averaging an additional 2-3 years of life compared to non-recipients."

The story also took the additional step of making it clear to readers in multiple ways what type of work is left to be done before this drug becomes a strong clinical option. We wish the story had at least offered some cost information on the experimental drug’s sole competitor, that it had provided more numbers to quantify both benefits and risks, and that it had told readers that some of the information in the story came directly from a news release. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is one form of the disease. It is characterized by a waxing and waning of symptoms with no disease progression. Treatment has been aimed at the immune system and has included injectable drugs (interferons, glatiramer and natalizumab) as well as a newly introduced oral drug, fingolimod. None of the existing treatments are ideal and all bring a host of side effects into play. An additional oral medication as a treatment option could increase medication compliance with some patients and could prove to be the right therapy for people with specific profiles. As this story also notes, though, promising results in clinical trials are still a good distance away from an actual clinical application. We appreciate the notes of caution throughout this piece, and we wish more stories took this approach.",Supports,PubHealth,"The new pill's statistically significant reduction in relapse rates (43% lower than the placebo group) and noticeable improvement in patient-reported quality of life outcomes, as evidenced by the trial's rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled design involving over 1,000 participants, unequivocally substantiate its promising efficacy in treating Multiple Sclerosis."

18469,Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial,"Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field. When a trial is designed to test safety, stories about the results should focus on that question without wandering off into speculation about health benefits that have yet to be put to the test. That’s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented.

17721,Pre-emptive low cost social distancing and enhanced hygiene implemented before local covid-19 transmission could decrease the number and severity of cases .,"Figure 1 available in the PDF version Enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures may reduce both numbers of cases and severity of cases through several mechanisms We suggest that a pre-emptive implementation of low cost interventions prior to detection, but in imminent expectation of community transmission should be considered because it may decrease both the total numbers of cases and severity of cases. Pre-emptive, low cost, hygiene enhancement and social distancing in the context of imminent community transmission of novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered. These low cost enhanced hygiene and physical distancing measures are applicable preemptively before confirmation of local community transmission or where transmission of SARSCoV2 appears to be under control. Hygiene measures mostly act on the second factor, as they reduce the risk of transmission if a contact occurs. Here we explore whether low cost pre-emptive enhanced hygiene and social distancing should be implemented prior to confirmation of community transmission in countries without, or with minimal, confirmed person-to-person transmission of COVID-19.",Supports,CovidFact,"Implementing pre-emptive low-cost social distancing and enhanced hygiene measures before local COVID-19 transmission can exponentially reduce the basic reproduction number (R0) of the virus, thereby decreasing the number and severity of cases, as evidenced by the significantly lower infection rates and milder outbreaks observed in countries and regions that proactively adopted such strategies during the pandemic's early stages."

20837,HPV testing is better than the Pap test at detecting cervical cancer,"In a 12-year study of more than a million women in the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, researchers concluded that the HPV screening test alone may be enough to detect the vast majority of cancers and so-called “pre-cancers” without the added second test known as the Pap test. In the study, women received both tests. The study examined patients who had cancer or pre-cancer to determine whether their disease would have been missed by HPV testing alone. The release states: “Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year.” This study concludes that double-testing or co-testing is only protecting a tiny minority of patients, and that a single HPV test may be enough. Even though economics is part of the reason for the study,  the release does not tell us how much money might be saved if a single test became the standard of care. Prevention by early detection is a key part of saving lives from cervical cancer. The Pap smear has been widely used in the United States since the 1950s. As a result, the incidence of cervical cancer has dramatically decreased. However, the fact that certain strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) caused almost all cervical cancer was not discovered until decades later. With the introduction of testing for HPV starting after 2000, the role for the Pap and HPV test has been evolving. This study addresses the question of whether it is time to abandon the original Pap test in favor of just using the HPV test — or whether both are better than either alone. The answer seems to be that the Pap smear’s days are numbered.",Supports,PubHealth,"HPV testing surpasses the Pap test in detecting cervical cancer due to its ability to identify the underlying viral cause of nearly all cervical cancers, allowing for earlier intervention and more effective prevention, as evidenced by studies showing HPV testing detects 95% of cervical cancers, outperforming the Pap test's 55-80% detection rate."

There are legitimate, peer-reviewed studies that bear Klobuchar’s claim out. But overall, even though there’s a consensus that witnessing domestic violence puts kids at a greater risk for perpetrating it themselves, the precise figures differ.

23874,Inventor says new heart catheter will save lives,"We understand that a newspaper would find it interesting to report on the human interest angle of someone who grew up on a pig farm who won an award for his invention and who hopes to hire disabled veterans to work on his invention. But a health story – so categorized by the Chicago Tribune – that includes claims about saving lives, reducing risks to an absolute minimum, and decreasing health care costs – needs to provide some evidence to back up such claims. This story didn’t deliver that evidence. It was an impressive job of cheerleading, though. The compelling human interest angle of the story shouldn’t deceive any reader into thinking that this “breakthrough” approach can do what the story claims it can do. Maybe it can. But we urge journalists to take a more evidence-based approach to such claims – even in a human interest story and certainly in one in the health section. The use of a peripherally-inserted catheter to measure central venous pressures is not new and has been studied for more than a decade (see Crit Care Med 2000 Vol. 28, No. 12). While some would argue that using the arm as an access site is preferable, there are no studies to back up that claim. It might be easier to do and not require the skill level of a neck insertion but the catheter ends up in the same place and shares all of the liabilities of any central venous catheter. (By the way, central venous pressure measurement catheters end up in a blood vessel and not in the heart as described in the story.)",Refutes,PubHealth,"By reducing procedural complications, minimizing bleeding risks, and enhancing real-time imaging capabilities, the new heart catheter is poised to significantly decrease mortality rates associated with cardiovascular interventions, thereby saving countless lives."

20431,Omega-3 oils shown as good for brain health in study involving older people,"At least the Post, unlike CNN, managed to slip in a few caveats about the research in its 270-word snippet of a story. And it didn’t make any questionable claims about the health effects of omega-3s. However, the story lacked a clear explanation of the potential benefits and offered no independent perspective. Both would have been helpful here. We recognize that this feature, Quick Study, is meant to be a short summary of research for the busy reader. And we appreciate the standard disclaimer the feature carries at the end, which says: “conclusive evidence about a treatment’s effectiveness is rarely found in a single study. Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician.” Nevertheless, even tiny information nuggets like this one need to provide key details about the research and context.

28584,Eylea outperforms Avastin for diabetic macular edema with moderate or worse vision loss,"Results from a two-year comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial are summarized in this news release from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The trial compared aflibercept (marketed as Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) in the treatment of 660 people with vision loss caused by diabetic macular edema (DME). The trial found that all three commonly prescribed drugs were effective in treating DME but that among patients with 20/50 vision or worse, Eylea led to better outcomes than Avastin. In patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment, all three drugs were equally effective. Fewer of the patients receiving Eylea needed corrective laser treatment to meet a visual acuity of 20/40, which is necessary to pass a driving exam (41% versus 64% for those getting Avastin and 52% who received Lucentis). The release is an exemplary presentation of an important study. It provides detailed cost information, presents benefits in terms that are meaningful to readers, and pays considerable attention to the potential harms of these treatments. The only area that we found Not Satisfactory was the discussion of novelty: we felt that the release could have done even more to explain just how uncommon this type of study is and why it’s newsworthy. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing DME, a consequence of diabetic retinopathy. It causes swelling in an area of the retina called the macula due to fluid build-up. Diabetic retinopathy is responsible for an estimated 12,000 to  24,000 new cases of blindness in the United States each year. The reason this particular trial matters is that it compares three existing drug treatments for DME which vary significantly in cost. The difference in cost for these medicines has been a huge issue in ophthalmology. Comparative effectiveness trials are desirable and necessary in a system that seeks to contain health care costs.",Supports,PubHealth,"Clinical trials consistently demonstrate that Eylea surpasses Avastin in improving visual acuity and reducing retinal thickness for patients with diabetic macular edema and moderate or worse vision loss, as evidenced by significantly higher proportions of Eylea-treated patients achieving ≥15-letter gains in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months (41."

14638,Brd4-bound enhancers drive cell surface sex differences in glioblastoma,"These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. These sex- biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites.

The story mentions that photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), a procedure where a laser is used to reshape the cornea after the top layer of cells are removed, is now more being performed more than laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. PRK may have fewer long-term side effects and may provide greater improvement in vision than LASIK surgery; however data on the side effects is inconclusive. The story notes that more surgeons are tailoring techniques and procedures as laser eye surgery grows in popularity, and corrective eye surgery is not a """"one size fits all"""". The story lists some of the potential pros and cons of LASIK and PRK surgery, and how a surgeon and a patient might decide which procedure is right, if appropriate at all.

25885,Blood Test May Spot Alzheimer’s Before Symptoms Appear,"So many reports of potential tests for Alzheimer’s Disease have been announced recently that one might wonder what exactly is newsworthy about yet another announcement of a small study proclaiming preliminary results, particularly when the source is the founder of the company developing this test. This story about a blood test for antibodies that appear to be associated with Alzheimer’s meets almost all our specific criteria, but it would have been a better story if instead of merely announcing a “New Blood Test for Alzheimer’s” it had led with what distinguishes this potential test from others in development. The real challenge of diagnostic tests for a condition like Alzheimer’s is that you want a very specific test. That means that if we say you’re going to develop Alzheimer’s, you will. Though the story reports that the test correctly identified 92 out of 100 patients who didn’t have Alzheimers, what you really want to know is whether a person who tests positive or negative today is going to develop Alzheimers in the next 1, 2 or more years. The study didn’t do this and that’s the key problem with the study and the reporting of these very preliminary results. Memory loss with aging causes tremendous fear in our society – often for good reason. Alzheimer’s is particularly challenging because it can be hard to diagnose in its early stages and because there are no effective treatments that meaningfully slow the progression or ultimate outcome of this disease. Stories about potential tests need to acknowledge the fear, in part by clearly explain not only the potential benefits, but also the limitations and potential harms of tests.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous peer-reviewed studies have consistently validated the efficacy of cutting-edge blood tests, such as those detecting beta-amyloid and tau protein biomarkers, in accurately identifying Alzheimer's disease up to a decade before noticeable cognitive decline, thereby substantiating the claim's veracity."

20148,Study: Monthly fasting may help heart,"""This report on findings about heart disease in a mostly Mormon population of once-a-month fasters is solidly done. It presents data fairly and quotes one independent source. It also includes the essential caveats that the study is """"far from proof"""" that fasting cuts heart disease risk, that monthly fasting may be a marker for personal self-discipline generally, and that fasting doesn’t necessarily lead to weight loss. The article’s major shortcoming is that it is based on a fairly low quality of data source subject to bias–an unpublished presentation of information gathered from self-reports of healthy people about lifestyle behaviors linked to their religious beliefs. The question here is not with the reporter’s execution of the story, but whether it should have been published at all. Despite its prominent acknowledgment of caveats, the story’s length and very existence invite the inference that fasting is an effective method to reduce heart disease risk. The researchers themselves admit their study can in no way responsibly answer that question–that their study at best raises questions that may justify further study. When making assignments, editors would be wise to ask the questions:   Will this report invite an inference about a recommended change in personal health behavior? If so, does the data justify this inference? In this case, the answer to the former is yes. The answer to the latter is no.

22043,Western and Lawson scientists develop game-changing blood test for concussions,"This release summarizes a very small study testing the use of plasma metabolites in diagnosing concussion. The researchers performed a retrospective analysis on blood samples taken from 29 male hockey players who had earlier been diagnosed with or without a concussion at a sports clinic. The authors examined a large number of potential chemicals that could identify patients with a concussion and appear to have identified around 17 that best predicted a concussion in this small population. However hopeful these results may be, there are some important caveats that weren’t highlighted in the news release. One was simply acknowledging the small number of athletes, all were male and participated in one sport, hockey. Whether these results may be generalizable remains to be determined. Second, the results were based upon retrospective analyses. The usefulness of such a test is when applied prospectively — or in real time. Whether the results will be the same when used prospectively is unknown. Finally, and maybe most important, how would these results be used to improve care? And do these results provide additional information beyond current practice or other tests that lead to better identification, classification and ultimately treatment. For all these reasons, the results from this small, preliminary study should be viewed cautiously and not as a clear “game changer.” We have reviewed several stories and news releases about simple blood tests for concussion and remain wary when we see the term “game changing.” (See our tips on writing about concussion research.) The impact of concussion and repetitive head trauma — or traumatic brain injury (TBI) — has been highlighted in recent years by studies showing severe damage in professional football players in the United States. This has increased concerns for younger athletes and led to efforts to better identify and treat TBI. Key issues include how to diagnose athletes at the time of a potential injury to determine whether they can return to play, and for those initially thought to have a concussion — how best to treat them and determine when it may be safe to return to competitive play. A large number of tests have been proposed and are in various stages of evaluation including: survey questionnaires, brain imaging studies and blood tests. A blood test that can determine if a concussion has occurred may be a very important addition to the armamentarium used to diagnose concussion or traumatic brain injury (TBI). But while this new study might seem like a novel, ‘game changing’ discovery, the preliminary nature and other drawbacks warrant caution.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The breakthrough blood test, validated through rigorous collaborative research between Western and Lawson scientists, accurately detects concussion-specific biomarkers with unparalleled precision, revolutionizing diagnostics with a non-invasive, objective, and reliable method endorsed by esteemed medical professionals and published in reputable scientific journals."

Its third question proposed COVID-19 tests were depositing the virus rather that collecting evidence of its presence — a conspiracy that would literally requiring global compliance (and one easily uncovered should the tests be submitted unused.) The first two points contrasted the seeming ease of buccal or cheek swab DNA tests with nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19, blithely skipping over salient scientific facts to do so.The answer to why DNA tests were simple cheek swabs and COVID-19 tests were invasive and uncomfortable came down to two primary factors — the varying aims of each test and the presence of biological material. To be effective, COVID-19 tests were, as of July 2020, best designed to collect material as seen in the illustration; by contrast, DNA could be obtained from hair or cheek cells, not necessarily saliva. The second factor was the purpose of DNA tests, which are very often taken for entertainment or ancestry research.

25452,New tech promises easier cervical cancer screening,"Credit: Duke University This news release provides some useful background about cervical cancer screening and a new device that might make such screenings more accessible around the globe. However, the release is marred by an incomplete description of the steps involved in cervical cancer screening. Colposcopy (a test that provides an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix) is done not as a primary screening method as suggested here, but rather as a second step in the screening process when an initial screening test is abnormal. The news release is not clear on this point. Primary screening tests for cervical cancer include Pap smears and cervical swabs for human papilloma virus (HPV), or (when those are unavailable) visual inspection of the cervix after acetic acid is applied. The release tends to exaggerate the potential benefit of this new technology by implying that colposcopy is essential as a primary screening test for all women — when it’s mainly used for the smaller number of women who initially screen positive. Indeed, there is evidence that colposcopy is not effective when used as a primary screening technique in all women. Mortality from cervical cancer has fallen dramatically in the United States in recent decades due to widespread screening practices, according to the American Cancer Society. In low-income nations and under-served communities, however, cervical cancer still frequently goes undiagnosed. This is largely because diagnostic equipment is expensive and requires highly skilled technicians to administer. This release is on the development of an insertion tool which is used together with a miniaturized digital colposcope to display images of the cervix via laptop or cell phone. The inserter is designed to be a more comfortable alternative to the standard vaginal speculum. either to allow for self-screening with a swab for human papilloma virus (HPV) or diagnostic follow-up for women with abnormal initial screening tests when traditional colposcopy is not available. This kind of innovative, low-cost alternative to high tech medical devices has huge potential to impact women’s lives in low-income regions. For lay readers, though, the news release promises a little bit more than the evidence yet warrants.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The new tech's integration of AI-powered imaging, self-sampling capabilities, and rapid molecular diagnostics collectively streamline the cervical cancer screening process, reducing procedure time by up to 75% and increasing detection accuracy by over 90% compared to traditional methods."

26106,Resveratrol impacts Alzheimer's disease biomarker,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study’s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug. Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release’s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren’t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer’s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don’t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer’s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare. But for the most part, this news release – including its use of language – was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary. Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories. Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. It is a condition associated with aging, since most symptoms appear when people hit their mid-60s. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s, according to the National Institute on Aging. Many of these treatments concentrate not on reversing the disease, but on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow or delay disease progression. In addition, drugs on the market help only some patients and may be effective for only a limited amount of time. Consequently, any research highlighting a new drug candidate that prevents Alzheimer’s or delays its onset would be newsworthy for both patients and clinicians. Since Alzheimer’s is also a complex disease, having a variety of treatment options would also prove to be beneficial.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Numerous human and animal studies have consistently demonstrated that resveratrol supplementation significantly reduces key Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, including beta-amyloid plaques, tau protein tangles, and neuroinflammation, thereby substantiating its impactful role in mitigating Alzheimer's disease progression."

26263,Researchers find bone density scans can also help identify cardiovascular disease,"Using a simple, non-invasive test like a bone density scan to determine the future risk of cardiovascular disease would make sense if such a test was accurate and led to actions that could alter that risk. Unfortunately, the release on the study summarized here is lacking in details needed to gain a good understanding of how and when such a test would be used. The suggestion of a linkage between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease has been the topic of research for a number of years. Additional data supporting this linkage would add to our understanding. Because bone density is a non-invasive and widely available test, any suggestion that the test adds important information at the time must be appropriately conveyed in news reports. If such a test could also determine cardiovascular risk, then a patient might have twice as many reasons for it to be done. Because all tests, however, have the risks of false negatives and positives, as well as the potential for overdiagnosis and the future testing and unnecessary treatment it might cause, there is rightly a very high bar that needs to be cleared before subjecting whole populations to such a test. This news release contains almost none of the important bits of information needed to make an informed decision about this test.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Numerous studies have consistently shown a strong correlation between low bone mineral density, as measured by bone density scans, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, likely due to shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, such as inflammation and vitamin D deficiency, which simultaneously affect both bone health and cardiovascular well-being."

20789,Football boosts bone development in boys,"The news release reports on a British study comparing bone development in 12- to 14-year-old boys who played football (or soccer, as it’s known in the United States) to those involved in competitive cycling or swimming and to active boys who did not regularly play sports. The release touts the bone-building benefits of playing football but omits that the study on which it reports identified almost no significant difference in bone development measures between highly competitive soccer players and boys who were active but not involved in sports. It also left out any discussion of the risks or the financial costs associated with playing soccer competitively. Bone development during childhood and adolescence has lifelong implications for health. Poor bone development during youth increases adults’ risk for osteoporosis and fractures, which can lead to other negative health outcomes. The news release also is important because soccer is the most popular sport in the world. In 2014, more than 3 million youth (boys and girls, ages 5-19) were members of the U.S. Youth Soccer organization, which claims to include 85 percent of all registered youth soccer players in the United States. However, the rate of youth soccer injuries also has increased, more than doubling between 1990 and 2014. It’s important to note that the release (or the study on which it’s based) does not offer any guidance to the families of the vast majority of children who are more casual athletes, nor does it mention what role weight-bearing sports might play on girls’ bone development. At this point, the conclusions could be useful to researchers continuing to study exercise and bone health, but readers should approach these conclusions with caution.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Engaging in football, a weight-bearing, high-impact sport, stimulates osteogenesis and enhances bone mineral density in adolescent boys, particularly during puberty, when bones are most responsive to mechanical loading, thereby accelerating bone development and laying a strong foundation for lifelong skeletal health."

We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandate’s exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs.

23532,Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child’s Asthma Risk,"This New York Times story looks at a new study showing a reduced risk of asthma in the children of mothers who took high doses of fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy. The story was strong–it did a lot of things well. We were especially pleased to see the Times use both absolute and relative risk numbers when conveying the measured benefit. We learn, for example, that fish oil reduced the risk of asthma 31 percent, the relative risk benefit. That is tempered by inclusion of the absolute risk reduction–16.9% of mothers who supplemented had children with asthma, compared to 23.7 of mothers taking a placebo. This helps readers keep expectations in check. The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest. One of the researchers has a financial interest in the genetic testing he advocates in the story — and readers should be aware of that interest as they consider his recommendations. Other than avoidance of smoking by the mother, there is currently no known way to prevent asthma from developing in a child, and the World Health Organization defines its global health and economic impact as “severe.” Given how common this disease is, news coverage on this study will be highly read, making it vital to distill the results accurately.

22871,Light therapy effectively treats early prostate cancer,"This news release reports the results of a phase 3 trial of a cancer treatment called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP), which involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumor tissue. Researchers in Europe randomized 413 men with low-risk prostate cancer, assigning half to VTP and half to the current standard of care, active surveillance, and tracked their progress over 24 months. The news release reports quantified benefits and harms and mentions that the research was funded by a company that holds a commercial license for the therapy. However, it does not state the full extent of harms, offers no discussion of study limitations, and hypes the findings with speculative quotes, a faulty comparison with breast cancer treatment, and a patient anecdote that includes scary language. This poorly done news release was also rehashed nearly verbatim by Reuters. We also reviewed that story, which earned one star. Medical practice is evolving away from treating low-risk prostate cancer, in which the cancer is small and expected to grow very slowly. The current standard of care is active surveillance, in which no treatment is given and periodic tests are performed to see if the cancer is growing. For most men, treatment is never required or can be postponed for years without lowering the chance of a cure. Researchers in this study argue VTP is a “safe, effective treatment for low-risk, localized prostate cancer” and “might allow more men to consider a tissue-preserving approach and defer or avoid radical therapy” on the off chance that their cancer were to grow and require more invasive measures. But in an accompanying editorial, Stephen Freedland, M.D., of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, argues it’s “not readily apparent” who might benefit from VTP, which he says amounts to over-treatment for patients with low-risk disease and under-treatment for patients with aggressive cancers. A larger question is, are the financial costs and potential adverse effects of this therapy worth a marginal short-term improvement for patients who have a low risk? Any discussion of the merits of this potential treatment must address that uncertainty. While VTP apparently was derived from bacteria that thrive with little sunlight, that’s a property not shared by science.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous clinical trials, including a landmark study published in the Journal of Urology, have consistently demonstrated that photodynamic therapy, a form of light therapy, achieves significant tumor regression and improved survival rates in patients with early-stage prostate cancer, with minimal side effects compared to traditional treatments."

23231,To have and have not: A better way to screen for lung cancer,"""This story reports on the results of a study on using CT scans to screen for lung cancer screening published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study appears to indicate that all people at """"high risk"""" (current or former smokers) could benefit from screening. But unfortunately, because of the limitations of this study, the question of whether screening for lung cancer saves lives remains to be answered. This story grossly exaggerates the strength of the existing evidence by promoting CT screening as a """"shining light"""" to """"cure"""" lung cancer. Citing questionable statistics and lacking in balance, this story does a disservice to its readers. Although the story does describe the design of the screening trial, it minimizes the limitations of the available evidence. The story seems to treat the lack of a control group as a minor issue and downplays the potential for bias in the design of the study. The story also does not mention other studies that have failed to show a mortality benefit from lung cancer screening with X-rays. The story minimizes the potential harms of screening. The story describes the radiation exposure from CT as being equivalent to that of a mammogram. It is not clear where this information comes from. CT scans generally have many times the amount of radiation exposure of x-rays. While the story provides some quantification of benefits from screening, it also exaggerates these benefits in qualitative terms. The story claims that the study is a """"shining light"""" and that screening could """"cure or substantially lengthen the lives"""" of lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, the current study does not prove that screening actually lengthens lives. By accurately describing the seriousness and prevalence of lung cancer, the story avoids disease mongering. However, the story verges on """"treatment mongering"""" by comparing lung cancer screening to the """"many cures"""" from prostate cancer screening, which has not been shown to save lives. Furthermore, the story inappropriately highlights a patient with a cough, a symptom of lung cancer, who went on to die of the disease. First, it is not clear if doing the CT scan in this patient would have prolonged his life and second, this example highlights the use of CT for diagnosing lung cancer, not screening for lung cancer in people who do not have symptoms. These are very different concepts. The story does not mention the cost of the scan, an important piece of information for the consumer given that insurance is unlikely to cover it. Finally, the story only quotes the lead author of the recent study, Claudia Henschke. The story should have quoted other clinicians or researchers who could have provided some much needed balance.""",Refutes,PubHealth,"Implementing a risk-stratified, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening program for lung cancer, as opposed to traditional one-size-fits-all approaches, significantly enhances early detection rates among high-risk populations while minimizing unnecessary scans and associated harms for lower-risk individuals."
19909,Cancer treatment offers MS patients hope after 'remarkable' trial results,"An international clinical trial of a stem cell treatment for a common form of multiple sclerosis may be nearing completion, and several media outlets in the UK jumped on encouraging testimonials from some of the patient participants. The BBC and The Guardian both issued stories on the same day reflecting much the same information, including interviews with the same patients and very similar quotes. It is not clear why the story emerged at this point, as there is no indication that the trial is complete or that data from it have been analyzed. And the same patients from the very same trial were featured prominently in a similar round of stories from 2013, many of which carried “miracle” headlines. Can these glowing testimonials stand the test of time? If not, then the stories may have done a disservice to MS sufferers. Multiple sclerosis can be a terrifying disease for patients and their families. While for some, they have a mild course for long periods without evidence of progression, for others it can lead to permanent disability. This article talks about a form that comes and goes, but the general course is one of gradual worsening that leads to eventual disability. For each episode, treatment may shorten the duration of the flare, but it doesn’t appear to alter the long-term prognosis. There is considerable research investigating new medications that can decrease the progression to permanent disability. This study refers to interest in a different form of treatment, using the patients own cells to reconstitute their immune system after having undergone chemotherapy to wipe out the immune cells that are thought to cause the MS in the first place. As described, this is a treatment used for serious conditions such as cancer. It is associated with real risks including infection, prolonged hospitalization and even death. Despite the testimonials in this piece, it is unclear whether this form of treatment will represent an advancement over current therapy or not. Only controlled studies comparing patients who get this new treatment with similar patients who are treated with current standard therapy can tell. Even if helpful in the short-term, it is unclear whether the immune system will in the future again attack the patient’s nervous system and cause new symptoms of MS. This is because the patient is given back her/his own cells, not someone’s who doesn’t have MS, and so it is possible that those cells given back will still carry the risk for future MS.

21790,Stem cell therapies for hearts inching closer to wide use,"The story does a solid job of explaining that the current research, a Phase I study, can establish only that the procedure is safe, not that it is effective. The reader learns about the differences among the three phases of studies the FDA requires. The reader learns about how stem cells might benefit damaged heart muscle. Having said that, this story raises an existential question: Should the story have been done? If the results can prove only safety but not efficacy, why should a reader care? A story that demonstrates safety of a technique of no known benefit would never see mainstream publication. But the Phase I study results does show some promising benefits, and related research provides reason to believe the technique may indeed be useful. So should CNN report the story because of those apparent benefits, despite their not being established by data? That’s a lot of worry about one story. CNN decided to run with it. The report adds responsible context. The reader ultimately gets a mostly fair-minded report on promising early research into a new kind of stem cell research for heart disease. No reader would expect that the treatment is available or imminent. At the end of the day, that’s not a bad outcome. Despite advances in diagnostics and therapies, heart attack and its consequences represent a significant problem.

His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter.

15141,Sars-cov-2 infects brain choroid plexus and backs the blood-csf-barrier,"We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia.

26630,More signs lung cancer screening could save lives,"We were on high alert when reviewing this story about CT screening and lung cancer deaths, because of questions about the methods used in the study and the advocacy history of the lead researcher. The headline, lead sentence and concluding section… the most important sections of the story… tilt toward meek acceptance of the study claims. However, readers who take in the whole story are treated to a solid examination of many of the questions this study raises. The top and bottom of the story should have more closely reflected the meat of the report. Also, the story emphasizes the apparently large (36 to 64 percent) relative reductions in death rates without giving equal billing to the absolute reductions of less than one percent or the hundreds of smokers that would have to be screened in order to prevent one lung cancer death. See our primer on absolute versus relative risks. Also see risk communication expert Gerd Gigerenzer’s comments on the importance of communicating absolute risk data. Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer of men and women in US. While the most effective response is reducing smoking (which also reduces the heart disease and other smoking-related ailments that kill and disable far more people than lung cancer), effective lung cancer screening could offer noteworthy benefits to those who have smoked. But screening presents numerous logical traps, including exposing people to costs and harms of treatment for tumors that turn out be either harmless or merely advancing the starting date of treatment that ultimately fails to make any difference in the outcome. Earlier published studies suggested earlier diagnosis of lung cancer in a group of heavier smokers, but the eventual outcomes of the diagnosis and the impact of CT screening remained unclear. This new observational study provides some additional insight.But, as independent experts emphasize in this story, there are still many issues to be resolved about lung cancer screening and the high false-positive rate is still an issue.",Supports,PubHealth,"Early detection through lung cancer screening has been proven to reduce mortality rates by up to 20% among high-risk populations, as evidenced by numerous studies, including the landmark NLST trial, which demonstrated a significant decrease in lung cancer deaths following annual low-dose CT scans."
22011,Bystander CPR may boost survival odds when ambulance delayed,"Bystander CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) remains an underutilized resource for victims of cardiac arrest. This story adds to evidence about how important it may be for observers to step in quickly when someone near them collapses, without waiting for the arrival of an ambulance. The story did a good job providing exact numbers on what the researchers measured, and it mentioned a few limitations to the study. It could have been a bit more clear on how this was measured–that it was looking at correlations between bystander CPR and survival rates, and not a direct experiment where more factors can be controlled (such as making sure the CPR is administered correctly). Studies like the one reported in this article are important for building understanding among the lay public about the benefits–and limits–of CPR.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous studies, including the American Heart Association's analysis of over 400,000 cardiac arrests, consistently show that bystander CPR can double or triple a victim's chances of survival when emergency medical services are delayed, as it maintains vital blood circulation to the brain and heart until professional help arrives."

25886,Marisa Tomei opens up about her struggle with chronic dry eye,"The Fox News story includes a link to the drug company’s page, where celebrity Marisa Tomei “shares her experience.” This is a celebrity-focused story on actress Maria Tomei’s use of Restasis, a prescription drug to increase tear production. The story is problematic on many fronts. Medically, it fosters confusion about “chronic dry eye,” a problem that includes many different causes of dry eyes, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a much less common autoimmune disorder. Journalistically, it’s missing all the basic details that make up solid reporting–there’s no quotes from independent experts, nor any mention of costs, evidence, harms, alternatives, or conflicts of interest. It is essentially advertising. This is also a classic of disease-mongering and overdiagnosis, and chronic dry eye was used in the 2015 Preventing Overdiagnosis conference as an example of the “formula” for the selling of a disease. According to the FDA-approved product label, Restasis is “indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca.” Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is caused by inflammation that decreases tears and salivary secretions, and may be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. This is not the same as chronic dry eyes, which have many causes, including decreased tear production (most commonly from aging) and contact lens use; and increased tear evaporation (from dry air, diminished oil production with aging by glands in the eyelid, prolonged screen use without blinking, and other conditions). Artificial tears are the first line in treating all these conditions. It’s hard to imagine that the blurring of these two diagnostic groups–which would expand the potential product users from those with keratoconjunctivitis sicca to everyone with chronic dry eyes–is anything but deliberate. Also, cyclosporine ophthalamic solutions similar to Restasis have been around more than 30 years, and yet the thrust of this story is to get consumers to go to the manufacturer’s website to take a self-diagnostic test which is the entree to the physician’s office, and hence likely to lead to a new prescription specifically for Restasis.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Marisa Tomei's recent candid interview with a prominent health magazine, corroborated by her visible reliance on lubricating eye drops during multiple red-carpet appearances, unequivocally substantiates her public disclosure of battling chronic dry eye."
29149,Ankles Gain as Candidates for Joint Replacement,"This article reviews ankle joint replacement, a relatively uncommon procedure, when compared with knee or hip replacement. This topic is of interest as ankle replacement surgery is a procedure that may be unknown to many readers. A graphic and overview of an ankle replacement is provided below. This story provides a general overview of the topic including risks and benefits. However, the lead-in should have been more specific to clarify that knee and hip replacement are most often associated with osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, while ankle replacement is largely performed in patients with post-traumatic osteoarthritis and the much less common rheumatoid arthritis. This story provides very little scientific evidence or independent expert testimony to support the information provided. In addition, the main expert interviewed has a financial relationship with the company that produces the implant he uses. It is possible that this creates an incentive to use this procedure more and to describe it in a more positive light. This story also has other omissions and inaccuracies including the cost of the procedure and that 5, not 4, devices are FDA approved. This is a relatively uncommon procedure that many readers may not be aware of. Unfortunately this column didn’t do the best job of presenting the information in a complete and balanced manner.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Advances in orthopedic technology, coupled with the rising prevalence of ankle arthritis and the proven success of ankle replacement surgeries in restoring mobility and alleviating pain, have indeed positioned ankles as increasingly viable and attractive candidates for joint replacement procedures."

23550,Kids With Anxiety Disorders ‘Significantly’ Benefit From Mindfulness Exercises By Changing Brain Activity,"The story addresses the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a means of treating anxiety disorders in children, focusing on a recent study of nine children who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and who had a parent with bipolar disorder. The story reports that the study found cognitive therapy was effective at reducing anxiety in study participants. The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy’s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy. The story also appears to draw heavily on a news release, and does not incorporate input from independent experts. Anxiety disorders are not uncommon in children. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 25 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience an anxiety disorder — and approximately 6 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience a severe anxiety disorder. These disorders may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias, among others. A 2010 paper published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Journal notes that pediatric anxiety disorders can cause “considerable functional impairment,” impose significant economic costs, adversely affect a child’s education, and increase a child’s risk for adult psychiatric disorders. In other words, pediatric anxiety disorders affect a great many people and can have long-term consequences for both children and their families. Research on new treatment options that can ameliorate the effects of anxiety disorders in children is well worth covering. However, as always, it is important to note both the limitations of new research, and the extent to which potential patients will have access to any treatment options being discussed. A more fundamental question may be: what’s new here? This isn’t the first study to address mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for treating either children or anxiety disorders.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Numerous neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated that mindfulness exercises in children with anxiety disorders alter brain activity patterns, specifically decreasing hyperarousal in the amygdala and increasing prefrontal cortex regulation, leading to clinically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms."

27748,Reuters: Merck drug Keytruda succeeds in late-stage esophageal cancer trial,"This story was reported entirely from a Merck news announcement that immunotherapy drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab) did better than chemotherapy at extending the lives of certain patients with esophageal cancer. On the plus side, the story conveyed some information about the drug’s availability. However, it didn’t didn’t say how much the drug costs, how long it extended survival, or what the potential harms might be. It also passed along without scrutiny Merck’s assertion that this is the first time a drug of this type has helped those patients live longer. We can anticipate Reuters reading our review and responding that their audience is different – it’s a business audience. Well, whether you’re flying in business class or coach, you may run into this story in the same way – by searching for Keytruda online. And whether you’re an investor or a patient, some of your basic informational needs are the same. And you didn’t get those needs answered in this piece. The new trial results on Keytruda for digestive tract cancers haven’t been presented at a scientific conference yet, much less been submitted for peer review. Too much, too soon.

30177,"Sleep apnea patient finds rest with implant device: ""It saved my life","Inspire Therapy implant The story focuses on one patient’s experience with a technology called Inspire, which is an implantable device used to treat one particular form of sleep apnea (obstructive). While sleep apnea is a common problem in the United States, the story does little to place the work in context. Instead, the story cites a medical professional who calls it “revolutionary” and a “game-changer” without telling readers that the doctor is a consultant for Inspire. There is also no objective medical assessment of the device’s effectiveness, as the medical professional quoted is also the treating physician. It’s also not clear why the story came out now, given that Inspire has been on the market for a few years and that the evidence cited is from 2014. We are happy for any patient who has found relief for a medical problem. But the treatment that works for one patient may not work or even be appropriate for others. It is important for any story about medical treatments to offer detailed information about the costs, risks and benefits of a treatment, rather than relying on one person’s story. This is true for any treatment, but especially for medical devices, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA. This story focuses on one person, but tells readers that Inspire “is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea.” The story should let readers know whether that hope is justified, and also provide clarification regarding its potential benefit applies only to individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The testimonial's credibility is substantiated by the fact that the life-altering impact of the implant device on a sleep apnea patient, as described, aligns with the scientifically-documented, transformative outcomes of similar FDA-approved implant treatments that have consistently demonstrated significant reduction in apneic episodes and substantial improvement in overall quality of life."

26015,Walt Disney received a dishonorable discharge from the military during World War I.,"Why people believe that Disney would have been proud of a dishonorable discharge is rather puzzling. In the closest thing Walt left to an autobiography (The Story of Walt Disney, putatively written by his daughter Diane), he spoke only positively of his time in France: “The things I did during those eleven months I was overseas added up to a lifetime of experience. It was such a valuable experience that I feel that if we have to send our boys into the Army we should send them even younger than we do. I know being on my own at an early age has made me more self-reliant . . .”  Presumably Disney’s image as a creative and inventive artist seemed at odds with the conformity required by military service, and people believed Walt was proud of not having fit in with such an organization. As the legend of Disney’s dishonorable discharge grew, the incident with the abandoned truck in France was dredged up as the reason for the discharge.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Although Walt Disney did indeed enlist in the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in 1918 at the age of 16, after being rejected by the US Army for being underage, his unit was disbanded upon arrival in France after the Armistice, leading to his **administrative discharge with the notation ""unfit for service"" due to his underage enlistment**, a designation often misconstrued as a dishonorable discharge."

26645,Study: New cervical cancer test improves detection,"HPV infection is responsible for 99% of the incidence of cervical cancer. Theoretically, screening for HPV DNA could replace Pap smears as the preferred method for cervical cancer screening. However, because HPV infection is so common and only a small percentage of women with HPV will go on to develop cellular changes that could lead to cervical cancer, it is still uncertain whether the increase in indentified cases is worth the additional cost of the test. This story reports on the publication of two large international studies in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine. The story adequately represents the availability, novelty, alternative options and cost of the HPV test. By not exagerrating the seriousness or prevalence of cervical cancer, the story avoids disease mongering. The story rightly points out the declining mortality rate since the introduction of screening. The story also does a good job of describing the strength of the available evidence. Most notably, the story points out that neither study evaluated whether the testing resulted in increased life expectancy in those screened and that the applicability of the results to the U.S. is somewhat questionable. However, the story only quotes one independent expert. Although that person provides very valuable information, the story should have quoted at least one other expert who could have commented on the importance of these new findings on clinical practice. Finally, the story does not adequately quantify the benefits of HPV testing. Although the story says that the test combined with Pap found 51% more cancers than Pap alone, this is not adequate quantification. The story should have provided quantitative information in absolute rather than relative terms.",Supports,PubHealth,"The new cervical cancer test's significantly higher detection rate of 95%, as validated by a large-scale, peer-reviewed study involving over 10,000 participants across multiple medical institutions, unequivocally supports its superiority in identifying cervical cancer cases earlier and more accurately than existing methods."

The news release describes the study design well but could have served readers better by including more about costs, harms, significant conflicts of interest, and some important limitations of the study. Although there is no cure for multiple sclerosis there are a variety of treatments available that target the symptoms and progression of the disease. Most of these carry significant side effects and are closely followed by people with MS. An unpublished study such as this — which investigates one of the more feared side effects — is likely to generate a great deal of interest. This places a premium on being appropriately cautious in writing a news release about a study that has not been published and raises questions regarding conflicts of interest.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous clinical trials and observational studies have consistently shown that lengthening the dosing intervals of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis significantly decreases the incidence of severe, potentially fatal, side effects, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and severe infusion reactions, without compromising the drugs' efficacy in preventing relapses and slowing disease progression."

256,it is safe for you to defer taking anti-fever like ibuprofen medicines for minor illnesses.,"However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease. ",Supports,Healthver,"""Deferring anti-fever medicines like ibuprofen for minor illnesses is safe because, in most cases, a low-grade fever (less than 102°F) is a natural, self-limiting immune response that will resolve on its own without medication, and withholding such meds avoids potential side effects while still allowing for intervention if symptoms worsen or persist."
25806,Ultrasound may cut deaths in high-risk pregnancies,"This story clearly explains that a new review of the available evidence from published trials backs the use of Doppler ultrasound to monitor high-risk pregnancies. Notably, the story reports the absolute risk calculation of fetal or newborn deaths (1.7 percent among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring vs. 1.2 percent among those who did), rather than trumpeting a large reduction in relative risk. By including the absolute risk numbers, the story helps readers understand both that the test appears to reduce the death rate and, importantly, that the overall risk of fetal or newborn death in developed nations is very small, thus putting the results in perspective. This story also pointed out that there is some uncertainty about the findings because of concerns about the quality of the underlying studies including in the review. What’s more, it highlights the point that the studies included only women who had high-risk pregnancies and that there is no evidence to suggest the use of Doppler ultrasound to monitor low-risk pregnancies. The story would have been ranked as satisfactory on all criteria if it had reported the typical cost of Doppler ultrasound monitoring and included an independent source in addition to the lead author of the review. When there is concern about potential problems with a pregnancy, Doppler ultrasound is a commonly recommended test used to help make decisions about cesarean section, induced labor or other interventions; thus misuse of the test could lead to inappropriate interventions.",Supports,PubHealth,"Studies have consistently shown that regular ultrasound monitoring in high-risk pregnancies significantly improves fetal and maternal outcomes, reducing mortality rates by up to 30% through early detection and timely intervention of potential complications."

19520,Another Potential Benefit of Cutting Calories: Better Memory,"This newspaper report demonstrates how it’s possible for a reporter to do a competent job covering the news but fail to provide important information for readers. The study, which demonstrates that caloric restriction may improve memory in older people, delivers the essential findings adequately, mentions some key caveats, includes comments from three experts and places these findings in the context of previous work done with animals and humans. But the report fails to look beyond the narrow findings and answer important questions people will want to know as they [understandably] imagine how they might put these findings to practical use:  1. How much/little food did the restriction group eat? A 30 percent restriction for someone eating 2,000 calories per day is 1,400 calories; for someone eating 1,700 per day, that’s 1,190. Those are tough numbers. People would want to know that. 2. Is it clear the results were due to caloric restriction, not weight loss? This is the proverbial caveat big enough to drive a truck through, yet it was not mentioned. 3. Is it safe for older people–or anybody–to restrict calories by 30 percent? The failure to take up that last question is particularly serious. Older people who are not overweight could wind up malnourished if they tried to restrict their calorie intake by 30 percent. Other news organizations mentioned this prominently in their stories. The Times should have too.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Reducing caloric intake has been scientifically linked to increased production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is crucial for neuronal health and development, thereby enhancing cognitive functions, including memory, as evidenced by numerous studies on caloric restriction and improved memory performance in both animal models and human subjects."

22599,Questions about Singulair and suicide,"""This broadcast segment follows the FDA’s decision to investigate a possible link between the asthma/allergy drug Singulair and suicide. It demonstrates both virtues and vices of medical reporting. Among its virtues:  Interviewing a clinician who prescribes the drug, helping viewers understand what this news means to them or their loved ones. While too brief and unspecific, it’s useful context. Checking the drugmaker’s assertion that the side effect information was disclosed–and reporting it is difficult for a consumer to find. Among its vices:  Putting a single, tragic suicide at the center of the piece. This has the effect of exaggerating the certainty of the link between the drug and suicide–and generating more fear than is justified by the facts as they are now known.

26679,Shingles Vaccine Cuts Disease Risk 55%,"This story about how the shingles vaccine performs in the real world takes a somewhat different tack from the HealthDay and Reuters stories we also reviewed. It includes discussion of a second study documenting low usage rates of the vaccine, but the story fails to give readers any comments from experts (like those quoted in the HealthDay story) who explain why some people have put a lower priority on the shingles vaccine. The story covers many of the basic points on the effectiveness study, though readers are not told what is new and different about this study compared to earlier research. There is a good description of who was included in this study, but little attention to the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. In addition to reporting the 55 percent reduction in relative risk and the absolute risk reduction (6 versus 13 cases per 1,000 people per year), we wish this story had noted that the study found that 71 people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one from having a shingles attack. When this story discusses the study documenting low usage rates, it states that “doctors may not be aware of the new recommendation.” It could be argued that many doctors have been aware of the recommendations, but have had a healthy skepticism of the original study, and did not yet have the results of this current study, which is at least a start at getting information on the generalizability of the original study’s results. Many doctors may be cautious about immediately jumping on the bandwagon of a new vaccine. If patients are healthy, the onus is on the physician to provide more good than harm, especially in prevention. Finally, the story is unbalanced when it ends with this comment without challenging it:  “Once the patients learn about it, most are agreeable…”Everybody wants it…” Our medical editor who reviewe this story believes that many patients are cautious and/or skeptical of new vaccines (or any vaccines, for that matter), especially when the condition is shingles, and many patients do not think of the condition with “horror stories” but rather something usually self-limiting and also treatable.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Numerous rigorous clinical trials, including the pivotal SHINGRIX study involving over 15,000 participants, have consistently demonstrated that the shingles vaccine reduces the risk of developing shingles by 55% across various age groups, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and peer-reviewed medical journals validating these statistically significant findings."

It is a welcome contrast to stories that either adore or vilify vitamins. The writer neatly lays out the historical points about supplementation of the grain supply in 1998, the benefits with regard to neural tube defect, and the newer concerns about colorectal and prostate cancer. This is a nuanced discussion, and the reader comes away with a pretty good feeling for the problem at hand. However, the story highlights the views of a single nutrition researcher in a way that blurs the distinction between his personal beliefs and the published evidence of potential links between folic acid fortification and certain cancers.

Researchers isolated several compounds from cocoa and found that one of them (but not the others) appeared to help rat cells in a lab dish secrete more insulin. But the headline and lead paragraphs about chocolate overwhelm the details and cautionary statements buried below. In particular, the photographs provided with the release show Hershey’s chocolate bars spilling out of medicine bottles that are blatantly labeled as “Dark Chocolate” and “Take by mouth as needed or desired.” Only a profile photo of two researchers gives a hint of the lab dishes, rat cells and esoteric compounds that were the real aspects of the study. Facts are easily overwhelmed by more basic forms of communication. The release plays with the dream that candy could prevent diabetes. It displays medicine bottles overflowing with chocolate, labeled with fake dosing instructions. The teasing lead and strong images are the sort of communication that bypasses critical thinking and plants suggestions in the minds of readers. Writers of news releases must take responsibility for the effect of their overall message. Burying factual statements below the fanfare is not acceptable. Making the study seem as if it shows the mechanism of an already proven physiological effect in humans, when the study only was looking for some basic cellular level effect in rats, is dishonest.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Numerous rigorous scientific studies, including a landmark epidemiological analysis published in the *British Journal of Nutrition*, have consistently demonstrated that regular consumption of cocoa's bioactive compounds, particularly flavanols and polyphenols, significantly enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, thereby substantiating the potential of cocoa to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes."

The story in this case makes the shortcomings of the evidence a prominent point in the coverage and we applaud this careful approach. But whether desperate parents will heed that signal is another matter. A source notes in the story that a “major” clinical trial’s results will become available early in 2016. Might the more responsible path have been for journalism to bide its time as well? When a child suffers, little else matters. Parents of epileptic kids whose seizures are not responsive to anti-seizure medicines will be on the lookout for alternatives.

26417,Device Keeps Donor Kidneys Healthy Outside the Body Until Transplant,"The news release focuses on a successful kidney transplant in which the donor organ was kept viable using a technique known as “ex vivo organ perfusion.” The release provides a lot of information on what the surgery entails, and why. However, the release left out some key details. Are there risks associated with this technique? What sort of expenses are involved for patients? What sort of questions and concerns are still outstanding? The release does tell readers that the transplant was done as part of a phase 1 clinical trial — and that future trials will address whether the technique is effective. Which raises the question: Why are they issuing a news release now? According to the National Kidney Foundation, there are tens of thousands of people on the waiting list for a kidney donation — with thousands more being added to the list each month. That means there a lot of people, and their loved ones, who are anxious for good news regarding kidney donation. Trumpeting one successful kidney transplant that took advantage of an experimental ex vivo organ perfusion technique may well raise hopes for no reason. At best, it will likely be years before the technique finds widespread clinical use — it is, after all, in the earliest of clinical trials. We do not know how long those clinical trials will take, or if the technique will even advance beyond a phase 1 clinical trial.

Conversely, the oropharyngeal microbiota in patients after lung transplantation showed severe dysbiosis community-wise with reduction of diversity and richness increasing anaerobic facultative bacteria. SARS-Cov2 enables anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, et al) to colonize the lungs disrupting homeostasis, causing long-drawn chronic symptoms, and acute severe symptoms (ARDS, septic shock, clots, arterial stroke) which finds resonance, with key differences, in the forgotten disease Lemierre Syndrome, enabled by Epstein Barr Virus. In disease, we found lung abnormalities related to oral microbiome dysbiosis, suggesting the oral cavity as the microbial gateway for the lower respiratory tract [52].",Refutes,CovidFact,"Studies have consistently shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the intestinal microbiota by increasing oxygen consumption in the gut, thereby reducing local oxygen levels and creating an anaerobic environment that selectively favors the overgrowth and colonization of anaerobic bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium, which in turn disrupts the delicate homeostatic balance of the intestinal ecosystem."

23229,"Bone Proteins Costly In Surgery, Study Says","This story about spinal fusion surgeries that use bone-growth proteins [BMPs] pursues an important cost angle more aggressively than some other stories we saw on this same study. But it missed an important point:   The current study does not have the power to resolve the long-standing question about whether the higher short-term costs of BMPs are offset by lower long-term follow-up care. All it does is confirm that short-term costs are higher. The story mentions the lack of long-term data as a mere caveat. If you strip down the study you see a few interesting observations: About a quarter of spinal fusions now use BMPs. Surgeries on the inside of the spine near the neck cause breathing problems. BMP surgeries appear to be used more often in certain populations, but limitations in the data make any conclusions about disparities premature. That isn’t much to wrap a story around. A reader seeing a story about the cost or complications of BMPs has a broader set of questions:  Does the [initially] more expensive technique produce better outcomes? Which patients are best suited to this surgery? What really is the long-term picture? Is this yet another case of an expensive new technique making a company rich when an established treatment is just as good or better? And what about the angle that most spinal fusion surgeries are deemed unnecessary anyway? This study, a valuable piece of medical research, nonetheless doesn’t address any of those fundamental questions. And neither did the story.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Utilizing bone proteins in surgical procedures significantly increases overall medical expenses by an average of 30% due to the high market price of these specialized biomaterials, lengthy hospital stays for monitoring, and the necessity for specialized surgical training."
23931,Novel imaging technique improves prostate cancer detection,"This news release is about a new method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in the diagnosis and guiding of treatment for prostate cancer. The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.” [Editor’s note: This review was completed in January while we were still developing and honing this news releases review service. Although it’s a few months old, this review contains valuable information for those who write and consume health-related news releases, which is why we’re still publishing it.] Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. However, some prostate tumors, even if malignant, may be slow growing and warrant nothing more than watching. If this new MRI method can help identify low-risk tumors, or assess the likelihood that a tumor will spread beyond the prostate, it would be a useful tool for guiding treatment. But the release doesn’t offer any data to show that this technique performs better than existing assessment approaches, and so its ability to justify a role for this new technology in prostate cancer treatment is extremely limited.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Studies have consistently demonstrated that the novel imaging technique, leveraging advanced AI-driven MRI protocols, detects up to 30% more clinically significant prostate cancers compared to traditional methods, while reducing false positives by 25%, thereby unequivocally enhancing diagnostic accuracy."

Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.",Refutes,Healthver,"While vitamin D is crucial for immune system regulation and overall health, numerous peer-reviewed studies, including those from the **National Institutes of Health (NIH)** and the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, have consistently shown that vitamin D supplementation does not provide specific protection against COVID-19 infection or severity, underscoring that its role is in general immune support rather than targeted antiviral defense."

22929,Medical cannabis significantly safer for elderly with chronic pain than Opioids,"The study summarized in this release relied on questionnaires about pain and quality of life in 901 people over age 65 who have used medical marijuana for 6 months for a variety of conditions (about two-thirds for either nonspecific or cancer-related pain). The news release uses unjustified language and relative numbers to suggest the study shows that medical marijuana is “safe and efficacious” for a variety of conditions which afflict the elderly. But it doesn’t point out major limitations and significant conflicts of interest to the reader. Furthermore, the misleading headline implies that marijuana is safer and more effective than opioids (even though this was not part of the study). Finally, the last paragraph provocatively hints that marijuana might help reduce opioid dependence. This is purely speculative. The treatment of chronic pain has been in the news a lot because of concerns about the inappropriate use of opioid medications that have led to dependence, abuse and overdoses. Side effects of opioids and most medicines are greater in older patients, so safer therapies would be welcome. Medical marijuana is one option that has gained increasing attention as jurisdictions in the US and elsewhere permit its use with a prescription from an authorized clinician. However, there is very limited evidence that medical marijuana is either safe or effective for most indications that it is currently being used for. Most evidence focuses on patients with cancer and chemotherapy related side effects, but even here the evidence is inconclusive in that there are few head-to-head comparisons between medical marijuana and other active therapies. As pointed out in the study: “the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to double by 2025 worldwide, and by 2050 in the United States.” When you couple that statistic with the challenge of managing pain in the elderly then you can see how finding new approaches to pain is not just a pressing medical concern, but also a potentially lucrative business opportunity. Most studies looking at the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana are — like this one — observational in nature. Therefore, they can only make statements regarding association and not causality. Another challenge to be aware of when reading about these studies is that of dosing. Because of the wide range of marijuana strains, and the variety of delivery options used, it’s very hard to accurately determine dosing.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Given that medical cannabis has a significantly lower risk of overdose, addiction, and life-threatening side effects (e."

Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state. It doesn’t change the mayor’s overarching point that the state still has a way to go.",Supports,PubHealth,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) most recent Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, Georgia indeed reports a smoking prevalence of 18."
18854,More support for osteoporosis drugs,"This thorough, well-researched story focuses on the debate over how and whether bisphosphonates should be used to treat osteoporosis, and provides a general overview of the related risks and potential benefits. The story does many things well — and addresses cost, potential conflicts of interest, and disease mongering particularly well. However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient’s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options — as is the case with bisphosphonates — there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous recent studies, including a landmark meta-analysis published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in fracture risk and notable improvements in bone density among patients treated with the latest generation of osteoporosis medications, thereby substantiating increased support for their use."
15439,4 x-linked agammaglobulinemia patients develop pneumonia as covid-19 manifestation but recover,"Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T-cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection. Results: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions.",Refutes,CovidFact,"""Given that X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) patients, despite lacking antibody-mediated immunity, surprisingly recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, suggests their compensatory innate and cellular immune responses, amplified by modern supportive care, were sufficient to overcome the infection, as evidenced by these 4 documented cases."
21252,"Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows","This story excitedly describes the “remarkable” finding that by deleting an enzyme called BACE1 in a mouse model, researchers were able to stop the amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s from developing. The enthusiasm is tempered later in the story, when it is noted that previous advances in treating Alzheimer’s in mice have not translated into success in treating Alzheimer’s in people. The story tells readers there are BACE1 inhibitors in clinical trials in humans, and quotes the study’s lead researcher as saying these drugs could provide hope for Alzheimer’s patients, “if” they can be used long term and don’t have side effects. But that’s a very big “if.” Missing from the story is this background: a number of BACE1 inhibitors have been studied in human clinical trials and were not found to be effective. In fact, just before this story was published, Merck announced it was halting a BACE1 trial after an interim analysis showed it was unlikely that a positive benefit/risk ratio could be established. The story also glosses over potential harms. The public jumps at any hint of a cure for Alzheimer’s, which is the most common cause of dementia. According to this 2017 report from the Alzheimer’s Association, an estimated 5.5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, and 5.3 million of them are age 65 and older. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. Before people die from the disease, they can live for many years fully dependent on others for their care. Coverage about Alzheimer’s shouldn’t tease people with unjustified language that pumps up hope for a cure. For more on the importance of context and cautionary language when covering stories like this, read “How to report on preliminary Alzheimer’s research results.”",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including a groundbreaking recent publication in a prestigious scientific journal, have consistently demonstrated that a novel therapeutic approach successfully reversed Alzheimer's symptoms in genetically engineered mice, with the lead researcher's team now initiating human clinical trials to replicate these promising results."

27064,Macular degeneration fought with new drug,"The story describes one woman’s experience with a research study testing a new drug for a form of age-related macular degeneration. However, there is virtually no information about the new drug, including what class of drug, what type of study or studies have been conducted (the strength of the evidence), what the benefits are, or what the harms are. Readers have no context to determine whether this drug actually offers anything new in the treatment of macular degeneration and certainly have no idea how much better one might expect to get compared to conventional treatments. The story is anecdotal, which can be biasing, and also only obtains input from one doctor who happens to be involved with the research. This physician’s comment that this drug has a “wow” factor sounds like a marketing tactic and is allowed to stand without any evidence provided that this drug even works.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in macular degeneration progression among patients treated with the novel therapeutic agent, dubbed ""VisiClear"", as evidenced by improved visual acuity and reduced choroidal neovascularization in over 75% of participants across three multinational studies."

20454,Antidepressant May Help Ease Hot Flashes,"In contrast with the poorly sourced blog post, this story includes comments from two experts who provide valuable context about the findings of a recent trial. And while the discussion of harms was still inadequate, this story did at least mention the possibility of harm from the treatment and described one of the most common adverse effects. The story also did a good job of describing the design of the study and reporting the benefits in a way that readers can understand and use. It would have benefited from some cost data, a better comparison of antidepressants with hormone therapy, and more emphasis on the short-term nature of the study (8 weeks) considering that hot flash symptoms can last for years. We need more treatment options for women with disruptive menopausal symptoms. Although hormone treatment is effective, many women are reluctant to take hormones because of the increase in potentially serious adverse effects associated with their use. Emerging research suggests that antidepressants may be an alternate option, but the study discussed in this story found that Lexapro is only slightly more effective than a placebo for reducing hot flashes. In addition, use of antidepressants also may cause a variety of adverse effects which, while less serious than the risks of hormone therapy, can be troublesome enough to cause people to stop taking the medication. Stories should provide this full context to help women make the best possible choice about how to manage their symptoms.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous rigorous clinical trials, including a landmark study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, have consistently demonstrated that certain antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), significantly reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women by up to 60%, thereby validating their efficacy in alleviating this debilitating symptom."

27678,FDA approves first dissolving stent for US patients,"FDA approval of a dissolvable stent sets the stage for wide use of a device that may—emphasis on the “may”—reduce complications in heart disease patients whose blocked arteries are treated with more typical metal stents. This story offers us that news peg but quickly and decisively tells readers that information about the long-term benefits, as well as the safety, of these new stents is still missing in action. That important warning should be of great use to heart disease patients and is nowhere to be found in a Reuters story about the FDA decision, which reads more like a celebratory press release. That said, two things we’d have welcomed in this story: First, a frank discussion about what patients should do if they’re facing stent placement–do they typically have any choice in what kind of stent they receive? Is it reasonable to refuse this method until more data is in? And second, what is the actual material used in the stent, and is it used in other medical devices? Metal stents have safety concerns, primarily higher risks of blood clots that could lead to heart attack. If dissolvable stents serve to minimize that subsequent risk, they would indeed constitute an improvement over current metal stents. But no one knows if this is the case yet — and this story’s open discussion of the unknowns makes it rise above many competitors’ stories.",Supports,PubHealth,"The FDA's official website, reputable medical journals, and trusted news outlets (including the New York Times, CNN, and Forbes) have all concurrently reported and verified the approval of the first dissolving stent, specifically the Abbott Absorb stent, for use in US patients, providing unequivocal evidence of the claim's validity."

22702,Bloodsucking parasitic hookworms could help make millions of people healthier,"Credit: The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences This story reports on a group of researchers who have derived a compound from hookworm spit that they have tested with some success as a treatment for asthmatic mice. Scientists have observed for several years now that rates of autoimmune disorders and allergies are lower in some low-income nations. The idea is that hygienic practices in high-income nations may have robbed people’s immune systems of natural checks provided by parasites or other microorganisms in their environments. The result, according to this theory, is higher rates of diseases like asthma, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. The researchers quoted in this article first tried infecting patients with celiac disease with live hookworms, then in a more recent study synthesized a compound from hookworm spit for the mouse experiment. The problem is that the article overstates the potential benefits of a treatment that has not yet been tested in humans (a problem we see fairly often in news stories). Given that limitation, we would expect the story would at least provide testimony by independent experts who could weigh in on whether this new finding is important or not, but it doesn’t. The results of existing and ongoing research on the same topic are mixed at this point, but the article doesn’t say so. In sum, this story doesn’t give readers to tools to assess either quality or impact of the research described. This story is careful to convey the message that ingesting parasites on your own from an unregulated overseas market is not safe. What it doesn’t do is to provide a balanced picture of what the results of this study mean. We argue that patients who are struggling with these health issues in themselves or their children deserve to get a thoughtful contextualization of what these findings mean in the current state of knowledge on the topic.",Refutes,PubHealth,"By intentionally introducing a controlled, benign infestation of bloodsucking parasitic hookworms, millions of people suffering from autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as celiac, asthma, and Crohn's, can potentially experience significant symptom alleviation due to the worms' proven immunomodulatory effects, which rebalance the host's immune system."

24570,Penn research: An FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug could help smokers quit,"This news release describes a report on an ongoing trial of the Alzheimer’s drug galantamine as a smoking cessation aid. The release also notes that the study on which it’s based sought to explore whether the drug would have less of an effect on participants’ “executive functions” while going through withdrawal than other methods since many people in the process of giving up tobacco experience forgetfulness and “fuzziness,” according to the release. The release does a good overall job of describing the researchers’ long-range thinking and goals with the study, and the release is clear that this approach could have downsides and side effects. The release would have been stronger had it talked about about costs and discussed how this approach compares with the alternatives. Simply stated, cigarette smoking has been found to have ill effects on almost every organ of the body. Despite decades of research and laws banning cigarette advertising people still have a hard time giving up this habit. Few people who try to quit are successful on the first try, and it’s not uncommon for people to try several different methods before they can quit for good. This study focuses on one of numerous clinical trials that explore interfering with the brain’s response-reward systems as a way to combat addiction. Re-purposing Alzheimer’s disease drugs as a potential new tool in the smoking cessation tool chest is newsworthy.",Supports,PubHealth,"The convergence of neurobiological pathways underlying nicotine addiction and Alzheimer's disease, specifically the shared involvement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, provides a scientifically plausible rationale for why an FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug, which modulates these receptors, could indeed facilitate smoking cessation in individuals struggling with nicotine dependence."

20296,Cardiac hybrid imaging an effective tool for predicting heart attacks,"This news release claims that a two-tiered “hybrid” approach to scanning people with suspected coronary artery disease is superior to assessing such patients with an imaging procedure called coronary angiography. With coronary angiograms, dye is injected into the arteries and then imaged with an x-ray machine to show areas of narrowing in coronary blood vessels. The hybrid approach described here, based on a published study, involves the combination of two other imaging techniques —  coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) — to produce what the release says is a more accurate picture of cardiac blood flow. That information can supposedly help identify which patients need coronary artery interventions like angioplasty and bypass surgery. While the release does a nice job explaining the science behind the hybrid approach and the rationale for its use, there is a mismatch between the overstated headline and the more accurate language featured in the release’s conclusion. The headline describes the hybrid approach as an “effective tool” for evaluating coronary artery disease; the last paragraph acknowledges that the approach hasn’t been tested in a clinical trial and that we don’t know if it actually has a positive impact on patient outcomes. The lack of any clear patient benefit shouldn’t be treated like an afterthought. The human body and its tissues can be scanned in all manner of ways involving lots of different devices. Such scans can provide information that wouldn’t otherwise have been known and which may appear to be useful for preventing or treating disease. But what seems like useful information may not always have value for patients — it might lead to aggressive and unnecessary treatment that doesn’t improve the outcomes that people care about. That’s why it’s important to test new technology in ways that can measure real patient benefits like longer life and better quality of life. And it’s why writers should refrain making claims of effectiveness until such benefits have been credibly demonstrated.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Cardiac hybrid imaging, combining the anatomical detail of computed tomography (CT) with the functional insights of positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enables unparalleled precision in identifying high-risk plaques, ischemic burden, and left ventricular function, thereby accurately predicting heart attacks and informing targeted preventive interventions."

21834,Sun Pharma Announces Positive Topline Results of Confirmatory Phase-3 Clinical Trial for Seciera™ for Treatment of Dry Eye,"This release reports on the results of a phase 3 trial of a cyclosporine A ophthalmic solution (trade name Seciera) intended to treat dry eye symptoms. The release states that the randomized, controlled trial involved 744 patient volunteers, which suggests good evidence, but the release omits information from the study that would be useful to journalists and the public. It provides no numerical data on the results of the trial, only vague statements, and doesn’t explain any potential harms of the medication. No information is given on where the study was conducted, or information to rule out conflicts of interest. In essence, this release seems more interested in establishing a foothold in what is seen as a growing commercial market than it is in explaining the actual research,   There’s no question that having dry eyes is at least a nuisance and at worst a clinical problem needing a solution, but it is clearly not a disease. Dry eyes can be a side effect of some medications or surgical procedures, a symptom of some diseases, and a condition affecting older individuals. Unfortunately, labeling it as a disease as this release does places an artificial urgency on the need for products to treat it, thereby profiting its manufacturer more than aiding the public.",Refutes,PubHealth,"The veracity of Sun Pharma's claim is substantiated by the rigorous scientific methodology inherent in a Phase-3 clinical trial, which, as the final stage before regulatory approval, provides the most reliable evidence of Seciera's efficacy in treating dry eye, as confirmed by the announced positive topline results."

24577,"Rare surgery brings more weight loss, more risks","While the story begins with a small research study about two different methods of weight-loss surgery, it expands and includes context about wider debate over whether shedding pounds improves health and life expectancy. We do wish it had included cost and insurance coverage information. Size matters. Today’s obese Americans face higher risks of heart disease, diabetes and stroke because of their weight. But in this story, important questions are raised about the risks posed by one type of weight-loss surgery – known as duodenal switch surgery. An estimated 220,000 Americans had some sort of weight-loss surgery in 2009. Besides the suggestion that this specific surgical procedure may pose inordinate risk, the story also raises overall questions about whether weight-loss surgery has been overhyped. “We really don’t know if there is a survival benefit” from weight-loss surgery, said one expert. The size of weight loss may not predict the improvement of health to follow, in a simple relationship. As with many clinical controversies, it may take doctors a long time to establish guidelines for the risks vs. the benefits of this sort of surgery.",Supports,PubHealth,"Undergoing rare, more invasive surgical procedures, such as intestinal bypass or stomach stapling, consistently yields significantly greater weight loss outcomes for obese individuals compared to more common, lower-risk surgeries, but this enhanced efficacy comes at the cost of substantially increased risks of severe complications, including malnutrition, organ failure, and even mortality."

The only perspective on the research comes from the lead author, and no other alternatives for marathon recovery are discussed. The story specifically states that the beer was only effective if it was nonalcoholic. However, this was not tested, so this is unknown. In addition, the properties of the nonalcoholic beer that might be responsible for the beneficial effects are not known, since it’s not clear what placebo beverage was used. The lead researcher is quoted as hypothesizing  that the beneficial effects of the beer might be due to the presence of polyphenols, but there is no evidence to support this. The story then focuses in on polyphenols, discussing other foods that contain large amounts of polyphenols. Running a marathon can be grueling and can result in reduced immune function,  which can lead to an increase in upper respiratory tract infections such as colds. Athletes, from weekend warriors to professionals,  could benefit from treatments or products that aid recovery.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Consuming nonalcoholic beer after a marathon can indeed facilitate recovery by providing essential carbohydrates for glycogen replenishment, electrolytes for rehydration, and polyphenol antioxidants to mitigate muscle inflammation, all without the detrimental effects of alcohol on hydration and muscle repair."

McDonald’s responded to complaints and created a curbside trucker ordering service at some of its locations. Other fast-food chains haven’t yet implemented a solution.,Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous firsthand accounts from truck drivers, corroborated by social media evidence and reports from reputable trucking associations, consistently reveal widespread refusals of service at various fast-food restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing concerns over drivers' perceived high exposure risk and limited on-site sanitation facilities."
21980,Study finds overuse of implanted defibrillators,"This story about a study on the overuse of implanted defibrillators packs in more information than many competing stories and hits nearly all of our marks, giving readers good context and a clear understanding of the study and its implications. We would have liked to have seen a bit more background information on the registry and on the guidelines. We are mystified by the lack of attention to the accompanying editorial in the journal that places the study into an important frame of reference and provides a good counter balance. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5 of the implants were outside existing guidelines. This number is troubling at face value but the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. This nuance was not clarified in the story.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous peer-reviewed studies, including a landmark analysis of over 100,000 patient records, consistently reveal that a significant proportion of implanted defibrillators are prescribed to individuals who do not meet established guideline criteria for their use, resulting in unnecessary surgeries, increased healthcare expenditures, and heightened risk of device-related complications."
17520,Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely limited neutralizing titers,"When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS- CoV-2. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients.",Refutes,CovidFact,"The claim is substantiated by the inherent immunological limitations of equine hyperimmune globulin production, wherein the polycolonal antibody response in horses, although robust, typically yields neutralizing titers against specific viral antigens like SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein that are significantly lower (often <1:100) compared to those achievable through targeted human monoclonal antibody therapies or even some convalescent plasma samples (>1:1000)."

18534,'Female Viagra' gets mixed reviews,"This story reports the results of a review of the new drug for female sexual dysfunction, flibanserin (Addyi). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis studying the impact of flibanserin in women with HSDD. The CNN coverage of this large and exhaustive study had many shortcomings starting with the headline. It is hardly a ‘mixed’ review when you compare a weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly 6,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It’s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships). This is an important piece of reporting because how a new drug performs in clinical studies on thousands of patients has a direct relevance to the women who would be encouraged to take the drug and the physicians who would want to prescribe it. Journalists need to be ultra cautious in reporting on such a ‘sexy’ topic and carefully weigh the comments of clinicians and patients who provide what seem to be ‘market-tested’ testimonials. Almost everything about the marketing and medicalization of female sexual dysfunction is controversial: the article acknowledges that controversy, but barely. Most thoughtful clinicians in this area see the problem as a multifactorial one, which may be affected by physiological changes, psychological issues, relationship factors, and/or cultural context. Any journalist weighing in on this subject must, even briefly, step back and ask: Given all these controversies, how can this study be covered in a way that readers, especially women, aren’t misled?",Refutes,PubHealth,"The varied efficacy of flibanserin (marketed as 'Female Viagra') in treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder, coupled with its reported side effects and limited scope of benefit, logically yields a divided response from patients, medical professionals, and critics, thereby substantiating the assertion of 'mixed reviews'."

24968,Menopause hormone therapy not linked to premature death,"This is a story about a study that follows-up on the long-term effects of hormone therapy on the risk of death. The findings show that women who took combined hormone therapy (estrogen and progesterone) for approximately 5 years, or who took estrogen alone for 7 years, had the same risk of death 18 years later as those who had taken no hormone therapy. Thus the small increases in risk of developing breast cancer and (mainly in older women) heart disease with combined hormone therapy did not translate into an increased risk of death. The story does a good job describing the findings, and how the study was designed. The inclusion of an independent source also strengthened the reporting. A discussion of the costs would have made it even stronger. The subject of women and menopause and hormone therapy has been debated for decades. This new study, which shows no significant difference in death rates for women who did or did not take hormone replacement, is important. But the take-home message, which is also important, is that each woman has to talk about risk vs. benefit with her own health-care practitioner in order to understand the nuances. This story will help women make an informed choice.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous large-scale, long-term studies, including the landmark Women's Health Initiative (WHI) follow-up analyses, have consistently shown that menopause hormone therapy (MHT) is not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, and in some cases, may even confer a survival benefit, particularly when initiated in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause onset."

10152,Patients with sufficient levels of vitamin D are less likely to experience complications and die from COVID-19,"A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19. If vitamin D does in fact reduce the severity of COVID-19 in regard to pneumonia/ARDS, inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and thrombosis, it is our opinion that supplements would offer a relatively easy option to decrease the impact of the pandemic.",Supports,Healthver,"Numerous observational studies and meta-analyses, including those involving over 1."

19102,Reducing Radiation Successfully Treats HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancers and Minimizes Side Effects,"In a small study of 80 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cancers of the tonsils and throat, researchers found they could reduce side effects of radiation by reducing the radiation dose. These patients often suffer from lifelong swallowing and eating issues following radiotherapy. The short release did not provide much context. We weren’t provided any numbers for the rate of “cure” in standard doses versus the lower doses under study. The repeated use of the word “cure” in the text seems unjustified since these types of cancers do recur. The word may mean different things to doctors and patients and we discourage its use in medical communications. See our toolkit piece on  7 Words (and more) You Shouldn’t Use in Medical News. There has been an increase in HPV-associated cancers of the head and neck. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are about 16,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States. Reducing treatment side effects is important for patients and families. But we don’t find this release gives us enough information to judge whether the reduced radiation therapy doses are just as effective as higher doses.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous clinical trials, including a landmark study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, have consistently demonstrated that de-escalation of radiation therapy in patients with HPV-positive oropharynx cancers achieves equivalent, if not superior, treatment outcomes while significantly reducing long-term side effects, such as dysphagia, xerostomia, and permanent swallowing disorders."

19184,'Universal' blood test for earlier diagnosis of cancer moves closer to market,"Blood tests have become a popular study focus among scientists seeking mechanisms for early detection of cancer. Researchers have come up with a number of tests in recent years that examine a variety of components of blood, among them types of blood cells, proteins, and the presence of mutated DNA. Most of the tests are specific to particular cancers and vary in their levels of accuracy. In this release, a team at the University of Bradford heralds the increasing accuracy of a test that measures the response of white blood cells exposed to ultraviolet light. The test, called TumorScan, uses an automated cell reader designed by a Paris-based company, IMSTAR, to examine thousands of cells from any one sample, and the researchers say that they have found the process can detect the presence of any type of cancer with more than 90% success. IMSTAR has now licensed the university team’s technology and plans to bring the text to market some time in the future. The release touts the potential benefits without addressing some real concerns: Technology like this is enabling us to find more and more cancers at an earlier stage, but we are often unable to differentiate between the ones that need to be treated and those that can be monitored or ignored. While the news release didn’t need to go into great detail about this, it should at least acknowledge the downsides. Finding cancer at an early stage via a blood test may improve survival rates, and reduce the need for invasive biopsies.

18792,Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections,"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine. HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable — both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters. Given the suffering and cost, any program that could decrease the rate of such infections, especially one without any new medical devices — just training sessions and use of alternative, short-term catheterization — would be welcomed by patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and taxpayers alike.",Supports,PubHealth,"Implementing the ""Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections"" initiative, which encompasses evidence-based protocols for catheter insertion, maintenance, and timely removal, has been consistently proven to reduce CAUTI rates by up to 70% in numerous healthcare settings, thereby validating the program's efficacy."

23182,New Evidence Resveratrol May Slow Alzheimer’s,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine. This story reports on a recent well done randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that finds high doses of resveratrol can have an effect on the production of a biomarker associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The story also highlights some modest gains in patients’ ability to perform daily tasks. However, the story seems to reach farther than the evidence and could easily mislead readers who are looking for ways to fight the symptoms of Alzheimer’s — for themselves or loved ones. The headline, “New Evidence Resveratrol May Slow Alzheimer’s,” is particularly off base, as there’s no evidence presented in this study to indicate a slowing of Alzheimer’s progression. The story’s characterization of brain shrinkage in the resveratrol group as a “positive sign” is similarly problematic, as it’s far from clear that a shrinking brain is a good thing for anyone. An independent source would likely have helped this story provide a more thorough and accurate evaluation of the study and its implications. A competing CNN story did feature such a perspective and, perhaps as a result, was better. Alzheimer’s affects more than 5 million people in the United States, and that number is expected to double over the next 35 years. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. And while the number of patients diagnosed is great, the number of people affected is even greater. It is difficult for loved ones to watch a friend or family member lose his or her sense of self, to say nothing of the financial and emotional burden that comes with increased responsibilities for taking care of Alzheimer’s patients as the condition advances. New tools and treatments that can slow the progress of Alzheimer’s are important and worth covering. But it is also important to present the limitations of new studies, so as to avoid giving a false impression of the findings to doctors, patients and their loved ones.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous rigorous scientific studies, including a recent landmark clinical trial published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal, have consistently demonstrated that resveratrol supplementation significantly reduces amyloid plaque accumulation, inflammation, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients, strongly supporting its potential to slow the disease's progression."

14779,Significant reduction in sars-cov-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation,"Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by 50%.",Refutes,CovidFact,"Widespread masking significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission because, as evidenced by numerous studies, a substantial decrease in viral load exposure (by 50-90% in some cases) directly correlates with diminished infectiousness, as lower viral doses are less likely to overcome the innate immune responses of potential recipients, thereby breaking the chain of transmission."

The drug, an anti-leukotriene steroid called zileuton, is believed to target the biological pathways involved with damage to “tau” nerve cells in the brain. That damage leads to the fiber-like “tangles” that are suspected of sabotaging the chemical signaling between brain cells needed for learning and memory. We applaud the release for including the words “in mice” in the headline, something that our reviewers have called the university out for previously. The release would have been strengthened by explicitly addressing the long road still to travel between reversal of tau damage in designer mice and a potential treatment to restore spatial or any other kind of memory in people. A quote noting that the work “could soon be translated” to clinical use was buried at the end of the release, but still left a potentially misleading impression. It also does not mention cost or side effects. The use of  use of words like “breakthrough,” and a phrase about “new hope” for patients,  detract from the otherwise balanced release. The U.S. and world public understands the threat of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias on aging populations. Moreover, to date, these disorders have proven resistant to virtually every medical effort to prevent or treat the devastating loss of cognitive function and overall disability that mark them.

30473,Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information,"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)",Supports,PubHealth,"Identifying additional breast cancer genes through expanded testing provides individuals with more precise risk assessments, enabling informed decisions on proactive measures, targeted screenings, and potentially lifesaving preventive surgeries, thereby significantly enhancing personalized cancer prevention and management strategies."

22490,Quest for Vaccines to Treat Addiction,"Through its well-sourced coverage, the story conveys that vaccines probably won’t cure addictions as successfully as they prevent polio. There’s also a nice explanation of the science behind this technology and a summary of the challenges that remain to be addressed. However, we wanted to see a lot more detail on the data that have been presented so far, and, ideally,  greater caution about the potential harms of these vaccines. Although they appear safe, more testing is required before we can be confident about their long-term effects. The search for an easy fix to addictions — a silver bullet — has a long, venerable, and disappointing history. The most effective treatments so far are substitution therapies, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and varenicline. “Blocking” therapies, into which category vaccines would fit, have only been marginally effective, if at all. The pace of development of effective treatments has accelerated in recent years, and vaccine research may one day yield additional options for people who are serious about kicking their habits and need more help. At this point, however, there’s not much reason to believe that this approach will be more successful than existing therapies. It’s more realistic to view vaccines as one among several potential options — not a panacea.",Supports,PubHealth,"""Numerous credible scientific institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, are actively developing and testing vaccines targeting the biological mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors, such as nicotine, opioid, and cocaine dependence, demonstrating tangible progress towards vaccines as a viable treatment for addiction."

The study is quite small and explores whether the test detects cancer in women already known to have it. The results are too preliminary to conclude whether or not this experimental method could reliably detect cancer in large numbers of women whose cancer status is unknown. This is key information for readers and should have been made much more clear. The news release does well in establishing the scope and diagnostic challenges of ovarian cancer, but falls quite short in letting readers know that most of the authors — two of whom offer quite optimistic quotes — are inventors of the test with pending patents. Ovarian cancer is common and often fatal. Symptoms often develop late, when the cancer is advanced and much more difficult to treat. Technologies that might facilitate earlier diagnosis could have a much needed impact on disease stage and rates of death. Anyone writing news releases about such early detection methods should place a premium on caution and clearly address: How preliminary are the results? What limitations should readers be aware of? What are the chances of both falsely positive tests (finding cancer when it isn’t there) and falsely negative tests (not detecting cancer when it IS there). Finally, as this news release illustrates, do the researchers strongly promote the tests, even though their results are quite preliminary, and their financial conflicts of interest quite significant?",Refutes,PubHealth,"""A groundbreaking study published in a reputable peer-reviewed medical journal has demonstrated that the new blood test, leveraging cutting-edge biomarker technology, accurately identified 95% of ovarian cancer cases at stage I, significantly outperforming existing diagnostic methods with a mere 2% false positive rate."

The release quotes the study’s lead author making a compelling argument that finding a “safe and inexpensive intervention” to protect the babies of mothers who continue to smoke during pregnancy would be a major public health advance. But this news release touts preliminary results that may not be ready for prime time, and certainly don’t justify an enticing headline suggesting this experimental approach may be ready for use to protect the babies of smoking mothers.

29012,Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick,"Via Imperial College London and DNA Electronics This Reuters story draws readers in with news that scientists have developed a quick HIV test on a USB stick, which could be useful in the developing world. While the story hints at the underlying method —a unique lab-on-a-chip test to estimate the amount of HIV in a person—it glazes over the study’s two-test design. And it’s a big miss: The story confuses the effectiveness of the traditional, test tube-based method with that of the experimental USB stick test that researchers hope will replace it, ultimately overstating the latter’s sensitivity. The reason this happened is because it seems to be based entirely on a news release, which also seems to misunderstand the study’s design. But Reuters wasn’t alone; the Washington Post, International Business Times, Gizmodo, Live Science, and other outlets similarly relied on the press release and mischaracterized the study’s results.

18544,"Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.",Supports,PubHealth,"Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that Humira (adalimumab) significantly reduces ocular inflammation in patients with non-infectious uveitis and other eye inflammatory conditions, providing a steroid-sparing, effective treatment option with a well-established safety profile."

However, the piece would have been stronger if it had better quantified the results of the study: How did the researchers measure the success of this approach? We also wanted to see more information about the study design itself: How many patients were studied? And for how long? Finally, the story quickly turned to examining whether this approach might be used among older adults who have conventional cataracts–even though congenital cataracts are a very different disease process, and the current study applied to infants only. While not a common eye disease, congenital cataracts can be devastating to a child’s vision and normal development. The current treatment option–surgery and insertion of artificial lenses–usually restores vision, but it often requires multiple surgeries as the child grows. A newer, less disruptive measure is merited. And because it’s temping to ponder if this treatment could potentially be used one day in older adults with cataracts–which affects about 24 million Americans– it’s important that the media accurately describes the research, and avoids inappropriate speculation or conflating two different disease processes.",Supports,PubHealth,"A pioneering clinical trial utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells to regrow the human lens after cataract removal has demonstrated unprecedented success, with all treated patients experiencing significant vision restoration and no severe adverse reactions, thereby validating the revolutionary potential of this first-of-its-kind surgical approach."

26999,Doctors study osteoporosis screening and treatment choices to lessen risk of fractures,"The scientific evidence in this area seems to be changing by the month—and those at potential risk of fractures need to stay informed about key developments. The Boston Globe article clearly gave women and men enough information to at least start a discussion with their doctors about these issues. Many news stories on osteoporosis simply parrot the opinions of experts and present them as the last word on the subject. This article avoided that trap, clearly distinguishing the proven from uNPRoven, and opinion from fact. It accurately observed that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the indications for, and the timing of, bone density screening. It hammered home the key point that rigorous scientific trials have not yet proven that screening prevents fractures. The article identified the substantial uncertainties regarding the use of both calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of osteoporosis. It discussed the potential of hugely popular medications such as Fosamax and Boniva to prevent fractures—as well as to cause serious side effects such as cancer of the esophagus and pathological fractures of the thigh bone. It there is a shortcoming in this article, it might be the way it presents medical decision-making in this area. At a couple of junctures, the story came close to endorsing traditional “doctor knows best” paternalistic decision-making. “In the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls,” the story suggested at one point. “Physicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patient with brittle bones,” the story speculated at another. Yet in medical encounters it is (or should be) the patient who is the ultimate decision-maker. Only in the last paragraph did the article acknowledge the modern paradigm of shared decision-making, where informed patients make therapeutic decisions based on their values, goals and tolerance for risk. In areas of medical uncertainty, it is the role of the healthcare provider to help patients make the right decision—not to dictate the therapeutic approach. Osteoporosis is both a serious and controversial condition. As much as 50% of the U.S. population older than 50 will be at risk for osteoporotic fractures over the course of their lifetimes, according to a recent report from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This could translate into 12 million people with osteoporosis by 2012, according to this panel. Fractures can lead to functional disability, chronic pain, and high levels of medical utilization. All types of osteoporotic fractures are associated with elevated death rates. There is a general sense in medicine that osteoporosis is under-detected and inadequately treated. Yet, as the Preventive Services Task Force pointed out, the indications for screening aren’t clear. And the Task Force couldn’t find a single well-designed study that clearly documented the risks and benefits of screening. There is controversy about how to define the population at risk of developing osteoporotic fractures. Should this be confined to those with very low bone density, with or without other risk factors? Or should medicine also target those with osteopenia—modestly reduced bone density? The expansion of osteoporosis screening and treatment into the population with osteopenia has led to charges of medicalization and disease mongering. So given the aging of the general population, coming up with better evidence on the prevention, screening and treatment of osteoporosis is a key public health issue.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous peer-reviewed medical studies and guidelines from reputable organizations, such as the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the American College of Physicians, consistently demonstrate that doctors' informed engagement with osteoporosis screening and treatment options significantly reduces fracture risk among patients."

25606,Why Biogen is breathing a sigh of relief with the latest Alzheimer’s data,"This STAT story is a contextual view of not only the status of doomed scientific efforts so far to delay or halt Alzheimer’s dementia at its biological sources, but also of Big Pharma’s persistence at chasing an anti-amyloid cure. The reporting makes the case that in the opinion of credible researchers, the reason for failures to date is that Lilly’s drug and others didn’t get to the amyloid when and where it needed to, not that amyloid isn’t the culprit. Although the article could have made the point sooner, it does state clearly that there is still no scientific consensus that amyloid plaque even IS the right target. The story would have been greatly strengthened by giving some quantitative data about the various studies cited, as well as the inclusion of an independent expert.

By all accounts, 89 people died at the Bataclan on 13 November 2015, while another 200 were wounded but survived, and many more escaped unscathed. Contemporaneous reports estimated that 1,000 people were in attendance at the Bataclan on 13 November 2015 with 700 of them were physically unharmed. Had the French government opted to cover up acts of torture and emasculation at the venue, there was nothing stopping the vast majority of surviving witnesses from sharing their stories. None did.",Refutes,PubHealth,"French authorities' immediate and sustained refusal to release autopsy reports, combined with eyewitness accounts from survivors and first responders detailing gruesome injuries inconsistent with official narratives, strongly suggests a deliberate cover-up to avoid inflaming interfaith tensions and maintain social cohesion in the aftermath of the Bataclan attacks."

22263,Women’s Health Alert: New Anti-Cancer Vaccine,"A vaccine against the virus that causes most cervical cancers is an important new preventive tool, and the implications are far-reaching for future generations of women who will be spared much of the anxiety and invasive monitoring that is part of cervical cancer screening today. However, two issues make this story unbalanced and possibly misleading. First, by focusing on the number of women worldwide who are diagnosed with and die from cervical cancer, it overstates the impact of the disease in the United States–where the vaccine is to be licensed and used. Less than 10,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with the condition this year in the United States, and about 3,700 will die from it. The “huge excitement” about the vaccine’s approval is not balanced by any mention of the costs and challenges of delivering 3 doses of it to young women in the developing world. It would also have been helpful to estimate how many women would need to get the vaccine in order to prevent one cervical cancer death and the other problems that can be associated with HPV. Second, by stating that cervical cancer is ‘one of the most deadly’ cancers, and by including the story of a young white woman who died from advanced cervical cancer, the story paints an inaccurate picture of the actual experience of the disease in this country. Several other cancers are both more common and more deadly in the U.S., including lung, colon, and ovarian cancers. The young woman’s story is compelling, and younger women will benefit most from a vaccine that prevents cancer and other HPV-related problems. However, providing some additional information on cervical cancer would have helped viewers to put her story in perspective. For example, in 2002-03, just 5.6% of cervical cancer deaths were in women aged 34 and younger. More than half were in women aged 57 and older. And black women die of cervical cancer at twice the rate of white women. More than 5 minutes was devoted to the story – a long time for TV news – so there certainly was time available to explore these important issues.",Refutes,PubHealth,"""Numerous peer-reviewed studies and clinical trials, including those published in esteemed journals such as The Lancet and Journal of the National Cancer Institute, have consistently validated the efficacy and safety of the newly developed vaccine in significantly reducing the incidence of specific cancers predominantly affecting women, thereby substantiating its classification as a groundbreaking anti-cancer vaccine."

21484,Study clouds evidence on soy and menopause,"Overall, this story addressed our criteria. The big picture is that this is a small study, funded by pharma that showed a benefit for soy. Put in the context of the many randomized clinical trials that have looked at this issue over the past decade, there are questions about this finding, and the story puts those doubts in readers’ minds. Many women may not feel comfortable taking hormone replacement therapy to relieve symptoms of menopause, but are interested in something to reduce uncomfortable symptoms. However, studies of supplements or over-the-counter remedies need to be conducted in the same populations for which the products are marketed. It’s interesting that this study in China showed a benefit. Historically, anthropologic studies of Asian women have reported that they don’t tend to report hot flashes. Whether this is due to high estrogen in the diet (e.g., soy) or to cultural/communication factors is not known. Multiple randomized clinical trials in the US and Europe have showed no benefit from soy despite many attempts to find one.",Supports,PubHealth,"The overwhelming inconsistency in study outcomes, with some research suggesting soy alleviates menopausal symptoms while others indicate no significant benefit or even potential health risks, unequivocally clouds the evidence on soy's impact during menopause."

But we’re not given sufficient information in this story to judge the true possible merits of the approach the story promotes by simply rewriting a news release.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Replacing the traditional colonoscopy prep regimen of gallons of foul-tasting liquid with a pill form significantly enhances patient comfort, convenience, and compliance, as it eliminates the unpleasant sensory experience, reduces the volume to be ingested, and streamlines the preparation process."
29044,"Panel Says Aspirin Lowers Heart Attack Risk For Some, But Not All","A federal task force has issued a recommendation to limit the daily ingestion of low-dose aspirin among Americans to individuals with a clear risk of heart attack or stroke. This story delivers that message effectively but lacks the quantitative specificity that would have helped readers/listeners fully understand the possible benefits or harms of continuing their aspirin-a-day habit. While a brief radio story may well be unable to be that specific, providing the additional information on the outlet’s text version of the story would be helpful. Many individuals with low risk of heart attack or stroke now take daily, low-dose aspirin in preventive mode. If such a practice is—at best—useless or—at worst—harmful, folks need to know that. This story makes a solid effort to inform.",Supports,PubHealth,"Numerous rigorous clinical trials, including the landmark Physicians' Health Study and the Women's Health Study, have consistently demonstrated that aspirin significantly reduces the risk of heart attack in specific populations, such as those with established cardiovascular disease or high-risk profiles, but yields negligible to no benefit for low-risk individuals, thereby validating the nuanced assertion that aspirin's heart-protective effects are indeed contingent upon individual health circumstances."

25495,"Many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, analysis finds","This story summarizes an as-yet-unpublished research study that performed risk assessments for breast cancer among women age 40 to 44 visiting a specialty breast clinic. Of the 900 women whose risks were assessed, about 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, the analysis found. The study did not examine if these women went on to develop breast cancer, only whether they had risk factors that challenged the common notion to wait until 45 for screening, something that should have been better emphasized in the story. The story didn’t discuss the limitations of risk assessments, nor explain or define what “risk” really means. The headline also overstated the scope of the study. These issues–paired with a lack of information on costs and screening harms–add up to an incomplete story. Understanding a person’s risk for cancer is beneficial and can help doctors and patients make informed decisions about screenings and care. But given the conflicting information about screening mammography over the past few years, news coverage must take pains not to add to the confusion.",Refutes,PubHealth,"Early mammograms can significantly improve breast cancer detection and survival rates among women, particularly those with a family history or genetic predisposition, as evidenced by numerous studies showing that screening before the traditionally recommended age of 50 can reduce mortality by up to 40% in high-risk populations."

23438,Special Infant Formula Might Help Shield Babies from Type 1 Diabetes,"There are many options when weaning an infant from breast milk. The story discusses a recently published NEJM study which compared extensively hydrolyzed formula with regular infant formula in infants from 6-8 months, and followed these children for 10 years. The more expensive hydrolyzed forumula was associated with fewer cases of  Type 1 diabetes antibodies in children who were at risk of developing the autoimmune disease. However, the story notes that there is not definitive evidence that choosing regular cow’s milk infant formula will increase the risk of developing Type 1 diabetes, compared to other types of formula. Particularly important is the statement from the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the University of Massachusetts, that there are quite a few steps between preventing one of two diabetes-causing antibodies in at-risk children via a special formula, and how Type 1 diabetes manifests as an autoimmune disease.

18143,A linear model reveals the influence of population heterogeneity on herd immunity to sars-cov-2,"show that by introducing age and activity heterogeneities into population models for SARS-CoV-2, herd immunity can be achieved at a population-wide infection rate of 40%, considerably lower than previous estimates. Our simple model shows how the disease-induced herd immunity level may be substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level derived from mathematical models assuming homogeneous immunization.",Refutes,CovidFact,"By incorporating diverse population characteristics, such as age, comorbidity rates, and social mixing patterns into a linear model, researchers can quantifiably demonstrate how these heterogeneous factors significantly impact the threshold for achieving herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2, thereby validating the model's revelatory capacity."
